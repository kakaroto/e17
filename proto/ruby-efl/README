=== 1. INTRODUCTION ===

Unsurprisingly, this package provides ruby bindings for various EFL libraries.

Currently it works for Etk, Ewl and Enhance. And it's still in developement.
It works for most things, but there are still some the ugly bits, rough edges and lack of
documentation common to all things in this state.

The bindings are implemented in pure ruby, using ruby/DL and are almost completely 
generated with a script that parses the C header files.
This makes maintenance tremendously easy, which is important because the API of some of 
the wrapped libraries is still subject to change.

The downside is that the syntax for using them might feel a bit unpleasant to ruby
purists in some corner cases. And they are possibly less performant than a C-based 
solution, although I didn't have the chance to run any benchmark to prove that.

There's another set of bindings called ruby-efl. It is maintaned by Tilman Sauerbeck and 
hosted at http://www.code-monkey.de/pages/ruby-efl.
It is different from this one in both style and scope: it is written entirely in C and it
covers evas, edje, ecore and esmart. 
Be sure to check it out if you need to use these libraries in your ruby programs.

=== 2. DOCUMENTATION ===

The main sources of documentation are, in order: 
- the examples in the examples dir of each bindings. 
- myself and other users, if any. hop on IRC and ask away (see bottom of this README)
- the source, if you can make sense of it (it's commented, but might not be enough)

=== 3. BUILDING ===

Install the prerequisites (you will be warned later if you do not):

A - ruby 1.8.4 (i only tested on this version, sorry)
B - CAST (C parser for ruby) http://cast.rubyforge.org/
C - gcc (i use only the preprocessor and you can easily hack-in any other preprocessor)

The rest of the setup will be handled by the setup.rb script. Launch it without any
parameters to get a summary of its usage.

Generally you want to just call

ruby setup.rb install

This will build and install all the bindings, parsing the headers directly from the CVS tree.
It will also install the bindings into the standard ruby library path, so you can require
them from anywhere.

If you don't want to install, use "build" as first parameter to setup.rb
If you want just one or more bindings, but not all, just append a comma separated list after
the command. Look at the usage banner to see what are the supported libraries at the moment.

=== 4. USING ===

If you installed them, all you need to do to use the binding for library <foo> is:

require 'ruby-efl/foo/ruby-foo'

If you have not installed it, you can require ruby-foo.rb with full path and it will work.
However, if want to copy the bindings around, for example locally to your application, 
there's a caveat: the ruby-foo.rb files will alway need to require dl_auto.rb 
*from the directory below them*. 
So always copy both and keep the directory structure in place.

From this point on, you're are on your own for now.
I suggest you look at the examples in the `examples` directory for each binding to see how 
they are used. More documentation will come sooner or later. 

See below for how to poke me for questions, threats, requests etc.

=== 5. COMMON PROBLEMS ===

These are some of the problems encountered by users so far:

-- You get an error that mentions "ruby-breakpoint" during build or usage.

This means I have forgotten again to remove debug statements and I richly deserve spanking. 
You can either bug me, or install ruby-breakpoint with `gem install ruby-breakpoint`. 
It's a very useful package anyway, so it might even be that I did you a favor.

-- You get an error that mentions DL::Importable. and you have installed the dl2 library.

It seems that dl2 and ruby/dl are not playing along very nicely. The fix for the unfortunate
finder of this problem was to reinstall ruby althogether. You might have better luck by just 
uninstalling DL2.
In any case if you have DL2 and either get this problem or you don't, please let me know 
about it. It helps investigating this shady issue. Thanks.

=== 6. CONTACT ===

You can email me at nerochiaro@gmail.com or nerochiaro@nerochiaro.net

Or join the #edevelop, #etk or #ewl channels in irc.freenode.net and ask me questions
directly. 
If I don't answer in a while, leave me a /msg and I'll get back to you when I come back.

Finally, you can also report issues in the bug tracker at:
