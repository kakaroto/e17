lvs-gui 
Copyright (C) 1999 Carsten Haitzler and Simon Horman

The lvs-gui enables the configuration of servers running the Linux Virtual
Server (http://linuxvirtualserver.org/) kernel patches. This code
is released under the terms of the BSD Licence.

The lvs-gui is run on a client with an X display with shell access to both
the Linux Directors and the back end-servers that they load balance. The
gui writes configuration files to configure both ipvs, using ipvsadm on
Linux Directors and transparent proxying on back end servers using
ipchains.

On clients that run the lvs-gui only the lvs-gui programme needs to be
installed. If using the RPM distribution this is equivalent to installing
the lvs-gui RPM.

On servers that have the Linux Virtual Server patch applied and are to be
configured as a Linux Director, the init script /etc/rc.d/init.d/ipvs needs
to be installed.  This is equivalent to installing the lvs-gui-lvs-server
RPM.

On servers that run as back end servers, behind a Linux Director, the init
script /etc/rc.d/init.d/transparent_proxy needs to be installed. This is
equivalent to installing the lvs-gui-back-end-server RPM. 

Note: Back end servers need to be configured with IP forwarding turned on
and need to have IP firewalling compiled into the kernel.

By default lvs-gui uses ssh for access to remote hosts to execute commands
and copy files. For this to work cleanly the client that runs the lvs-gui
needs to have ssh access, with either an RSA key with a null pass phrase,
or key management using ssh-agent and ssh-add to access both the servers
that are Linux Directors and the back end servers. Alternative shell access
and copy commands can be specified, see options for details.

The GUI will configure the Linux Director to use direct routing, and as
transparent proxying is set up on the back end servers, the Linux Director
and back end servers can be on the same network both physically and
logically.


Options

lvs-gui has the following command line options. With the exception of
-r|--rc_file these can be configured through the gui itself and are saved
to an rc file, set by -r|--rc_file .
