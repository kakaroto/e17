######## EPLAYER EDJE GUIDE #########

An ePlayer theme consists of two Edjes:
 * The main Edje, called "eplayer"
 * The playlist item Edje, called "playlist_item"

The "eplayer" Edje emits the following signals:

    action,     SIGNAL_EMIT "PLAY_PREVIOUS" "*";
    action,     SIGNAL_EMIT "PLAY_NEXT" "*";

    action,     SIGNAL_EMIT "PAUSE" "*";
    action,     SIGNAL_EMIT "PLAY" "*";
    action,     SIGNAL_EMIT "STOP" "*";

    action,     SIGNAL_EMIT "SEEK_FORWARD" "*";
    action,     SIGNAL_EMIT "SEEK_BACK" "*";

    action,     SIGNAL_EMIT "SEEK_FORWARD_START" "*";
    action,     SIGNAL_EMIT "SEEK_FORWARD_STOP" "*";
    action,     SIGNAL_EMIT "SEEK_BACKWARD_START" "*";
    action,     SIGNAL_EMIT "SEEK_BACKWARD_STOP" "*";

    action,     SIGNAL_EMIT "TOGGLE_TIME_DISPLAY_MODE" "*";
    action,     SIGNAL_EMIT "TOGGLE_REPEAT_MODE" "*";

    action,     SIGNAL_EMIT "SWITCH_GROUP" "foo";

    action,     SIGNAL_EMIT "QUIT" "*";

    action,     SIGNAL_EMIT "SEEKER_START" "*";
    action,     SIGNAL_EMIT "SEEKER_UPDATE" "*"; 
    action,     SIGNAL_EMIT "SEEKER_STOP" "*";

    action,     SIGNAL_EMIT "PLAYLIST_ADD" "*";
    action,     SIGNAL_EMIT "PLAYLIST_DEL" "*";

The "SWITCH_GROUP" signal is special. It will reload the Edje using the
group "foo" (src argument). This way, you can easily implement
collapsed/expanded states etc.

ePlayer itself also emits signals:

    action,     SIGNAL_EMIT "PLAYBACK_STATE_PLAYING" "ePlayer";
    action,     SIGNAL_EMIT "PLAYBACK_STATE_PAUSED"  "ePlayer";
    action,     SIGNAL_EMIT "PLAYBACK_STATE_STOPPED" "ePlayer";

The first signal is emitted to indicate ePlayer is currently playing
a track, the second signal is emitted to indicate playback is paused,
and the third signal is emitted to indicate playback is stopped.

The Edje provides the following parts for text display, etc:

    Part: "title"             -> Window Title
    Part: "artist_name"       -> Name of artist
    Part: "album_name"        -> Name of album
    Part: "song_name"         -> Name of song
    Part: "track_bitrate"     -> Bitrate of song (in kbps)
	Part: "track_sample_rate" -> Sample rate of song (in khz)
    Part: "time_text"         -> Current pos in track ([-]00:00)
    Part: "vol_display_text"  -> Current Volume Level (0 - 100)

    Part: "playlist"          -> where to swallow the playlist
    Part: "seeker"            -> draggable set to track position (%)
    Part: "seeker_grabber"    -> special (see below)

The seeker:
  The seeker involves two parts. One, "seeker" is a draggable that gets set to the current song position (as a percent). Often, this can be an invisible part with other parts relative to it (to create a bar, for instance). Second is the "seeker_grabber" part, which captures mouse down/move events to actually seek. Create programs for this part that emit SEEKER_START on mouse down, SEEKER_UPDATE on mouse move and SEEKER_STOP on mouse up. 

Dragging:
  ePlayer contains an object underneath the theme that catches mouse events to allow window dragging. In order to take advantage of this, you must allow events to pass through to this layer in any areas you want to allow for dragging. Do this by adding "repeat_events, 1" to the relevant parts.


The "playlist_item" Edje contains a "title" and a "length" part.

These parts emit the following signals:

    action,     SIGNAL_EMIT "PLAYLIST_SCROLL_UP" "";
    action,     SIGNAL_EMIT "PLAYLIST_SCROLL_DOWN" "";
    action,     SIGNAL_EMIT "PLAYLIST_ITEM_PLAY" "";
    action,     SIGNAL_EMIT "PLAYLIST_ITEM_REMOVE" "";

ChangeLog:

7/28/03: Edje2 Intreface started drawing on the inferface
		of Native Instruments "Traktor DJ Studio"
7/29/03: Interface cleaned up emensly 
7/30/03: Added this README and abstracted signals



To Do:
	-> New controls need to be added (vol control?)
	-> Clipping layer for LCD doesn't work, hides 
		text when used (clip_to, )
	-> Layout methods for Buttons could be better ?
	-> LCD could contain more information and have 
		some seperation
	-> Buttons are currently 2 stage, should be 3-4
	-> Play/Pause buttons should stay down to illistrate
		that you are currently playing.

	-> Play/Pause button should blink when waiting......
