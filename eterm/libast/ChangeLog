Added name- and version-setting functions since we can't just use
PACKAGE and VERSION any more.

It usually helps if you finish writing the code BEFORE you commit it.

Insure++ found a small logic error here that could result in a tiny
leak under certain circumstances.

Added file.c for any file routines I write.  The first one is a secure
temp file generator.  If portability issues arise from non-POSIX
systems, they will be addressed here.

I have created a testbed for libast.  You can now run "make test" to
run a series of tests which will test some of the functionality of the
library.  I didn't finish all the tests I'll eventually have; I just
wanted to get the stuff that's immediately important.

I also added a new split() function, which functions somewhat like its
Perl counterpart, although there are differences.  This function will
be used in the remaining Eterm work I must do before release.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Moved chomp() to libast.  It's awfully handy.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue May  8 19:51:51 PDT 2001                    Michael Jennings (mej)

Added two more convenience functions:  join(), also borrowed from
Perl, and free_array() for freeing lists.  I also threw in a USE_VAR()
macro for getting rid of bogus unused variable warnings.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed May  9 17:20:46 PDT 2001                    Michael Jennings (mej)

Better handling of NULL values all around.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed "make distcheck."

----------------------------------------------------------------------

I moved the config file code from Eterm to libast.  I also relocated
some of the generic macros (MIN(), MAX(), BOUND(), etc.).  Version up
to 0.3 now.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 15 16:50:54 PDT 2001                    Michael Jennings (mej)

Cleaned up spec file in preparation for release.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Converted the ChangeLog to Avalon's log format.  Yay! :-)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 15 23:40:45 2001                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Moved the parsing of each config file line into a separate function.
You'll see why in a moment.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Oops.  ChangeLog entries were ending up in the bit-bucket.  Fixed and
re-synced. :)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jun 29 10:02:34 2001                        Michael Jennings (mej)

I think we can call this finished.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 23 18:01:37 2001                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Well that was dumb.  Comments are supposed to be *ignored*. :P
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jul 23 23:25:13 2001                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Damnit.  It was screwing up on blank lines too. >:I
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Sat Sep 22 09:24:41 2001                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Fixed a compilation issue on some systems where libX11 would not be
linked in with the test program.  This is libast 0.4.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Jan 21 18:02:20 2002                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Don't try this at home.  This package has been discombobulated by
trained professionals.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 12 00:03:12 2002                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Please ignore the warnings during compile.  I didn't want to check
this in just yet, but I kinda broke Eterm and committed it. :(
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 12 00:23:36 2002                        Michael Jennings (mej)

...and then I came to my senses....  :-P
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Feb 12 10:40:37 2002                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Still not fleshed out, but at least the warnings are gone. :-)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Feb 17 12:10:59 2002                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Hopefully now this will make more sense.  The string class is now
fleshed out...along with a complete set of unit tests. :)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Feb 18 21:54:25 2002                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Mmmmm...reusability. :-)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Mar  3 01:44:51 2002                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Added precision to the profiling stuff, and threw in the beginnings of
support for interface classes.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr  4 20:45:30 2002                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Lots of updates.  This should compile, but if it doesn't, don't blame
me.  (Well, blame me, just don't whine at me.) :-)

Also a bit of a design doc here...hopefully it will clarify some
things.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr  4 21:13:01 2002                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Re-indenting code.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr  4 22:24:36 2002                        Michael Jennings (mej)

Oops...
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Apr 11 18:03:46 2002                        Michael Jennings (mej)

The list interface is complete (for now) as is its first
implementation:  the linked_list class.  Unit tests are also in.
