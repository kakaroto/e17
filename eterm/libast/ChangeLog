Added name- and version-setting functions since we can't just use
PACKAGE and VERSION any more.

It usually helps if you finish writing the code BEFORE you commit it.

Insure++ found a small logic error here that could result in a tiny
leak under certain circumstances.

Added file.c for any file routines I write.  The first one is a secure
temp file generator.  If portability issues arise from non-POSIX
systems, they will be addressed here.

I have created a testbed for libast.  You can now run "make test" to
run a series of tests which will test some of the functionality of the
library.  I didn't finish all the tests I'll eventually have; I just
wanted to get the stuff that's immediately important.

I also added a new split() function, which functions somewhat like its
Perl counterpart, although there are differences.  This function will
be used in the remaining Eterm work I must do before release.

Moved chomp() to libast.  It's awfully handy.

Added two more convenience functions:  join(), also borrowed from
Perl, and free_array() for freeing lists.  I also threw in a USE_VAR()
macro for getting rid of bogus unused variable warnings.

Better handling of NULL values all around.

Fixed "make distcheck."

I moved the config file code from Eterm to libast.  I also relocated
some of the generic macros (MIN(), MAX(), BOUND(), etc.).  Version up
to 0.3 now.

Cleaned up spec file in preparation for release.
