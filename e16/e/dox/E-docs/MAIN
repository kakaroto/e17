Enlightenment is your Window Manager. The Window Manager controls the 
appearance of the borders of your windows, their behavior and
all user interaction with positioning, killing, resizing, moving, iconifying,
shading etc. your windows, virtual desktops, multiple desktops, menus attached
to windows and some root window menus and can also control the background
of your desktop(s).
<p align=50%>
It is a large and complex program and is by no means perfect, but it is being
worked on and is as stable as possible. It has many advanced features as well
as possibly missing some features. This version (0.15.5) is by no means the
end of development and improvements, fixes and new exciting features are
being worked on all the time. Please go and visit the _Web(web) site often, 
as new versions, fixes, patches and updates will be released.
<p align=50%>
It is hoped you enjoy using this software and that it is of benefit to you.
It might not be for everyone, but if it has made your day any better than it
was it has done more than enough already.

There is an Official Enlightenment IRC channel where you can go and "hang out"
if you want - talk to other E users, developers, get some help, drool 
together, or whatever. #E will kill me for this but get onto any EFnet irc
server (irc.efnet.org) then join #E. An example:
<p>
BitchX your_nick irc.efnet.org<br>
<br>
or<br>
<br>
irc your_nick irc.efnet.org<br>
<br>
or use your favorite graphical IRC client.
<p>
Please remember that it can get busy with 100's of people talking at once and
not everyone is actually listening all the time or are in the middle of a 
conversation - be polite and patient, and have a sense of humor and you'll
have fun.

This small tutorial is intended to take you step by step through Enlightenment
and its default setup, how to use it, modify settings, and put it to use for
you. When you have finished reading each page please press the NEXT button on
the top of this window to go to the next page.
<p>
If you are reading this right now you have managed to get Enlightenment itself
installed correctly and are either running Enlightenment for the first time or
have just upgraded to a new version. Congratulations. Now it's time to take
you on a quick tour of the desktop you will have before you.
<p>
Please remember that if you use a theme other than the default (Brushed Metal)
that is may look slightly or completely different to the contents of this
tutorial. Some behavior may also vary.







<page columns=1 padding=16 name=tut2 background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<img src=E_screen_start.png x=16 y=16>
<p>
Now that you have started Enlightenment, if you are using it for your desktop 
shell, your screen should look something like the image here on the left.
<p>
Across the whole top of the screen you will see a bar with arrows pointing 
up and down on the left and right ends. This is your desktop 
_Dragbar(dragbar) . 
<p>
On the bottom-left you'll see 3 boxes. The top box with the scrollbar attached
will be your _Iconbox(iconbox) .
<p>
The other 2 boxes below are _Pagers(pager) for desktops 0 and 1. Everything
else is your desktop background.







<page columns=1 padding=16 name=tut3 background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<img src=E_app_menu.png x=350 y=48>
<p>
When you click with your left mouse button on the desktop background you will
see an "Applications" menu appear (example displayed on the right here). 
Applications you may have installed will appear in this menu. To launch one 
of them simply select it from the menu.
<p>
Note: Menus in Enlightenment work like most menu systems. You can either hold 
down the mouse button and navigate with the button down, releasing on the
selection you want, or release elsewhere to not select anything, or you can
quickly click and release then navigate just by moving the mouse, and clicking 
again on the item you wish to select, or elsewhere if you do not wish to
select an entry.
<p>
If you wish to "stick" a menu up and leave it up so you can select items from
it multiple times, click and hold down the mouse and release on the title of
the menu (if it has a title) and it will remain up. You can move it and
manipulate it like a normal window. Close the window to unstick the menu.
<p>







<page columns=1 padding=16 name=tut4 background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<img src=E_settings_menu.png x=285 y=275>
<img src=E_enlightenment_menu.png x=4 y=30>
<p>
You will also find that instead of using the left mouse button, you click the 
right mouse button, a menu with the title "Settings" will appear. This is
Enlightenment's settings menu. From it you can select what parts of your
desktop that Enlightenment controls to customize and make more amenable to 
your own needs.
<p>
When you select one of these _settings(settings) a dialog window will appear
giving you options to configure that part of Enlightenment.
<p>
Clicking the middle button on the desktop background will display 
Enlightenment's main menu. You can access the other menus plus more options
(including those to log out, restart and display Help information) from this
menu.







<page columns=1 padding=16 name=tut5 background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<p>
You will also find that holding down the ALT key whilst clicking the middle 
mouse button will bring up a menu with the titles of all currently active
application windows. Selecting one of these will take you to that application.
By using the CTRL key instead of ALT you will get a menu displaying all 
current desktops as sub-menus, with applications on each desktop in the 
desktop sub-menu.
<p>
If your mouse does not have a middle button you should have enabled 
"Emulate 3 Buttons" in your X-Server - in which case pressing both left and 
right mouse buttons at once will be the equivalent of pressing a middle
mouse button. If this does not work this may not be turned on. Please see
your X Server documentation on how to configure this.
<p>
This may vary from system to system. OS and XServer may also vary the method 
in which you do this, if it is possible. Not having a middle mouse button in 
Enlightenment, or for that matter X is not a good thing as it is almost 
assumed to be there, and is used by many applications, as well as
Enlightenment.







<page columns=1 padding=16 name=tut6 background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<img src=E_mousewheel.png x=370 y=30>
<img src=E_mouse.png x=410 y=330>
<p>
If you have a Wheel-Mouse and X is configured to understand this Enlightenment
comes equipped with wheel support out of the box.
<p>
Rolling your wheel up on the desktop background will take you back a 
_desktop(desktops) or by rolling your wheel downward, you will advance 
forward a desktop.
<p>
If this doesn't work, then it may be you haven't configured your XServer to
understand a mouse with a wheel. If you use XFree86 you may need to edit your 
XF86Config to have a "Pointer" Section like:
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ccaacc>
<p>
Section "Pointer"<br>
Protocol    "MousemanPlusPS/2"<br>
Device      "/dev/mouse"<br>
ZAxisMapping 4 5<br>
Buttons      5<br>
EndSection
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<p>
You may need to modify this for your mouse.







<page columns=1 padding=16 name=tut7 background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<p>
When you start an application, unless it has special properties, it will come 
up on your screen with a border surrounding it that contains a titlebar and
several control buttons.
<p>
This border is the primary interface to controlling an application window.
The Default setup (shown on the next page) gives adequate control but still
retains simplicity.
<p>
If you click left mouse button on the titlebar and keep the mouse button down
the window will follow your mouse wherever it moves. Respectively if you click
your left mouse button and drag on any of the resize handles, the window will
be resized in that direction. Clicking right mouse button on the resize
handles will raise the windows to the top.
<p>
Clicking right mouse button on the titlebar or any button on the window 
operations menu button on the top-left will display a menu that has window 
manipulation options in it. 
<p>
Double-Clicking (clicking the mouse twice in succession really fast) will
make the Window shade or unshade (depending if it was unshaded or shaded to 
start with).





<page columns=1 padding=16 name=tut8 background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>

<p>






<page columns=1 padding=16 name=tut9 background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<p>
Clicking left mouse button on the iconify button will iconify the window
and send it off to the Iconbox. Hitting the Maximize button will maximize the
size of the application fill your screen. Hitting it again will Unmaximize, 
bringing the window back to its normal size.
<p>
Clicking with the left mouse button on the close button will close the window.
If the application that owns that window does not respond to a nice request to
exit, then pressing right mouse button on the close button to forcibly
terminate that window. This should not be used unless the application is 
visibly "hung".
<p>
In addition to these methods of manipulation a window there are additional
ways of performing these.
<p>
If you hold down the ALT key and hold down left mouse button anywhere in the
window (on the border OR in the application part) whilst dragging, you will 
move this window around. Doing the same but with the middle mouse button will
resize the window in that direction. Clicking the right mouse button anywhere 
in the window whilst holding down the ALT key will bring up the window 
operations menu.







<page columns=1 padding=16 name=tut10 background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<img src=E_keyboard.png x=312 y=0>
<p>
For people who want to use their keyboard to manipulate their personal desktop
there are a number of key combinations bound by default. They are as follows:
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#112222>
<p>
CTRL+ALT+Home - Re-shuffle windows on screen to be Clean
<br>
CTRL+ALT+Del - Exit Enlightenment and Log Out
<br>
CTRL+ALT+End - Restart Enlightenment
<br>
CTRL+ALT+Up-Arrow - Raise window to top
<br>
CTRL+ALT+Down-Arrow - Lower window to the bottom
<br>
CTRL+ALT+Left-Arrow - Go to the previous desktop
<br>
CTRL+ALT+Right-Arrow - Go to the next desktop
<br>
CTRL+ALT+X - Close the currently focused window
<br>
CTRL+ALT+K - Kill the currently focused window nastily
<br>
CTRL+ALT+R - Shade/Unshade the currently focused window
<br>
CTRL+ALT+I - Iconify the currently focused window
<br>
CTRL+ALT+Tab - Switch focus to the next window
<br>
CTRL+ALT+R - Shade/Unshade the currently focused window
<br>
CTRL+ALT+S - Stick/Unstick the currently focused window
<br>
CTRL+ALT+Enter - Zoom/Unzoom the currently focused window
<br>
CTRL+ALT+(F1 - F12) - Go directly to desktops 0 - 11
<br>
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
(more on next page ...)





<page columns=1 padding=16 name=tut11 background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#112222>
<p>
SHIFT+ALT+Left-Arrow - Move to the virtual desktop on the left if there is one
<br>
SHIFT+ALT+Right-Arrow - Move to the virtual desktop on the right if there is 
one
<br>
SHIFT+ALT+Up-Arrow - Move to the virtual desktop above if there is one
<br>
SHIFT+ALT+Down-Arrow - Move to the virtual desktop below if there is one
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<p>
Note: Zooming in and out of windows will only work if you have an XFree86 
server or one that implements the Xf86VidMode extension. You also need
to define lots of screen modes for your display, so ensure your "Display" 
subsection of your XF86Config looks like:
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ccaacc>
<p>
SubSection "Display"<br>
	Depth 16<br>
	Modes "1600x1200" "1280x1024" "1152x864" "1024x768" "800x600" "640x480" "512x384" "400x300" "320x240"<br>
EndSubSection
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<p>
Have a "Display" subsection per depth (this example is for 16 bit) and all
the resolutions defined as above.







<page columns=1 padding=16 name=desktops background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<font face=rothwell/25 color=#ffffff>
<img src=E_deskstack.png x=360 y=70>
<p>
Multiple & Virtual Desktops
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<p>
Enlightenment supports both Multiple and Virtual desktops. There is a fine but 
distinct difference between the 2, and enlightenment treats them differently.
<p>
When you start Enlightenment you will by default have 2 desktops. In
Enlightenment desktops are geometrically unrelated work areas. They are 
visually stacked on top of each other and can even be dragged down to expose
desktops underneath.
<p>
The best way to imagine this is that each desktop is a sheet of paper with the
first (desktop 0) desktop being glued in-place. You can re-shuffle the stack
of papers and slide one down to reveal a piece of paper underneath - the only
paper you can't slide is the first one. Each desktop (or sheet) contains your
application windows.







<page columns=1 padding=16 name=desktops2 background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<img src=E_deskarray.png x=350 y=140>
<p>
Windows normally live on one desktop, but can be made
to exist on all desktops - whenever you change to a new desktop the window
will follow you and be on that desktop too. This is known as being sticky.
if a window is sticky it will "stick to the glass of your screen" and stay
there until it is not sticky anymore or the window is closed.
<p>
Virtual desktops (also known as desktop areas) is a measure of how big your
desktops are. A desktop can be a multiple of your screen size in size (2x1, 
2x2, 3x3, 4x2 etc.). That means each desktop has an AxB screen size of area
allocated to it and you can be looking at any screen-sized part of it at any 
time. It's just like getting more sheets of paper and taping them to the sides
of your current sheet of paper. An easy way of changing your view is by just
sliding your mouse in the direction of a currently unviewable part of your
desktop and as long as you have Edge Flip enabled Enlightenment will 
automatically scroll over to that part of the desktop.







<page columns=1 padding=16 name=desktops3 background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<img src=E_deskimg.png x=275 y=81>
<p>
Enlightenment also allows you to set a different desktop backdrop per desktop
to help you customize your environment and differentiate which desktop is 
which.
<p>
An easy way of having Enlightenment automatically pick up any pictures you have
is to make a directory in your ~/.enlightenment directory called
backgrounds and then fill that with your favorite backdrops. Enlightenment
will automatically discover this and index them for you allowing you to
select them and change their settings. More on this topic is explained in the
_Settings(settings) section.







<page columns=1 padding=16 name=dragbar background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<font face=rothwell/25 color=#ffffff>
<p>
The Dragbar
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<p>
At the top of your screen, by default, you will notice a long bar you can 
click. If you click and drag this bar on any desktop except the first, you
will notice you can drag your desktop around to expose desktops below it.
<p>
This can be used to open up a gap between the current desktop and a desktop
below and then drag a window to the desktop below simply by moving the window 
there.
<p>
In addition pressing the middle mouse button on this bar will bring up a menu 
with a list of all windows - select a window to set the current focus to this 
window. Pressing right mouse button will bring up a list of tasks sorted by
desktop - select one and you'll set the focus on that too.







<page columns=1 padding=16 name=pager background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<font face=rothwell/25 color=#ffffff>
<p>
The Pager
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
The Pager to those of you new to the concept of virtual and multiple desktops
may be a foreign concept, but once gotten used to is highly useful in being 
able to manage your application over multiple screens that you might not 
necessarily be able to see.
<p>
The pager lets you see your desktop screen area in miniature. It lets you click
on a certain desktop to "visit" it, click and drag windows around in the pager 
itself to move them about the screen quickly, or between desktops.
<p>
Pressing right-mouse button over a blank portion of the pager gets you the 
pager menu, allowing you to change settings. Right-mouse button on a window
miniature will get you a small window operations menu. Dragging a window from 
one area of a pager to another will move it there, or to another desktop. 
Dragging it out onto the actual desktop will drop that window right there.







<page columns=1 padding=16 name=pager2 background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<p>
You can resize the pager to make it the size you'd like (hint - hint. hold down
ALT and use the middle-mouse button to resize the pager in any direction. using
left-mouse button whilst holding ALT and dragging will move the window. Holding
down ALT whilst pressing right-mouse button, just like any normal window will
get you a window operations menu).
<p>
In the default theme clicking the tab on the right side of the pager with the
arrow pointing right will shade and unshade the pager window horizontally, 
allowing you to hide and unhide the window easily.
<p>
The striped area above this tab on the pager's border is a handle that will
allow you to move the pager about, just like the titlebar of any window.






<page columns=1 padding=16 name=iconbox background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<font face=rothwell/25 color=#ffffff>
<p>
The Iconbox
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
The iconbox is the place the icons for all your iconified windows go. Whenever
you iconify or minimize a window it will go into an iconbox and have an icon 
displayed for it there. Clicking on the icon again will de-iconify it. Clicking
right-mouse button anywhere in the iconbox will bring up a menu to configure 
that iconbox. If you accidentally close your iconbox and want it back, you can 
bring an iconbox back by selecting "Create New Iconbox" from the Desktop 
sub-menu of the desktop menu tied to the middle-mouse button.
<p>
You can actually create as many iconboxes as you like and move them about,
rotate them differently, change each iconbox's settings to be different, and
Enlightenment will use the iconbox closest to the window when you iconify it.
<p>
By default below the iconbox you will find a scroll bar with scroll arrows 
that you can use to scroll around your iconbox if it fills up with iconified 
windows.







<page columns=1 padding=16 name=properties background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<font face=rothwell/25 color=#ffffff>
<p>
Remembering Properties
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
In the window menu of every window (you can get to this menu by clicking on the
upper-left menu button, right-mouse on the titlebar of a window or by pressing
ALT and right-mouse button anywhere in a window) you will see an entry labeled
"Remember...". If you select this it will bring up the "Remember" dialog for
that window (note: only one of these dialogs can be active at any one time).
<p>
This dialog lets you selectively snapshot certain attributes of that window at
that time and have Enlightenment remember them. you may chose to only remember
some of the attributes, and possibly not have the application started
automatically for you. Chose what you want Enlightenment to remember about that
window and hit "Apply" or "OK" if you don't need the dialog anymore, and
Enlightenment will, the next time that instance of the application is run,
apply the current location, size, border style or any other attribute to
that window. Enlightenment can also launch the application for you if you
so wish.







<page columns=1 padding=16 name=settings background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<font face=rothwell/25 color=#ffffff>
<p>
Settings
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
When you click the right mouse button on the desktop background you will pop 
up the Settings menu. From here you can select an aspect of Enlightenment to
configure to your liking. There are too many settings to actually document
fully right now, but the likelihood is if you want a particular behavior from
Enlightenment, it is achievable by merely playing with these options.
<p>
Combinations of options are often required to get the effect you want, so some
experimentation may be required. Do not be frightened. Nothing you can do
can't be undone by simply changing the options back to how they were and 
clicking on Apply again.







<page columns=1 padding=16 name=groups background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<font face=rothwell/25 color=#ffffff>
<p>
Window Groups
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
Sometimes you have a number of windows on your desktop that logically go together,
like for example the pager windows. Enlightenment allows you to group windows
together, so that whenever you change a property of one window in a group,
the change is reflected on the other group members.
<p>
The properties that you can change for an entire group include setting the window
border, iconifying, killing, moving, raising/lowering, sticking and shading of
a window.
<p>
To define what properties are applied to a group by default, you go to the
_settings(settings) menu and pick the "Group Settings" option, which will give
you a dialog window in which you can configure the settings.
<p>
There are two different ways for manipulating window groups. First, there's a
submenu available in each window's operations menu called "Window Groups", which
has all available options mentioned above.





<page columns=1 padding=16 name=groups2 background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<p>
Here you can also toggle an effect that is called "mirroring" of group properties:
Enabling this will force all properties that can be in two different states (like
shaded/unshaded, sticky/unsticky etc.) to be the same one for all group members.
<p>
The second way is the window titlebar, which has the most important options
directly available for convenience. These are shift-clicking for starting a group,
ctrl-clicking for adding a window to the youngest group (also referred to as the
"current" group) and shift-ctrl-clicking for destroying a group. You can also click
the middle mouse button for visualizing the group(s) of a window. Click again for
returning to the previous borders.
<p>
Note that a window can be in multiple groups at the same time, so for a number of
these options you have to indicate which group you are referring to. You can do
this by selecting the appropriate checkboxes (showing the group members' titles)
at the top of the dialog windows.
