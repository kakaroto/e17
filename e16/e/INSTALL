Welcome to the Enlightenment Installation Instructions.  Here, we'll try to go
over everything that you need to know in order to compile and install
Enlightenment on your system.  

Thanks to the joy of automated documentation, there is lots of additional data
here for compilation instructions.  If you have already compiled Enlightenment
and are having trouble getting Enlightenment to come up after you have ran
"make install" - please skip to the end of the file and read the 
"Setting Up Enlightenment For My User" information.

Basic Installation
==================

   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
those values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of Enlightenment.
It may also create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent
definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that
you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, a file
`config.cache' that saves the results of its tests to speed up
reconfiguring, and a file `config.log' containing compiler output
(useful mainly for debugging `configure').

   If you need to do unusual things to compile Enlightenment, please try
to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
diffs or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can
be considered for the next release.  If at some point `config.cache'
contains results you don't want to keep, you may remove or edit it.

   The file `configure.in' is used to create `configure' by a program
called `autoconf'.  You only need `configure.in' if you want to change
it or regenerate `configure' using a newer version of `autoconf'.

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing Enlightenment's source code and type
     `./configure' to configure Enlightenment for your system.  If you're
     using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type
     `sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute
     `configure' itself.

     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

  2. Type `make' to compile Enlightenment.

  3. Optionally, type `make check' to run any self-tests that come with
     Enlightenment.

  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
     files that `configure' created (so you can compile Enlightenment for
     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  There is
     also a `make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly
     for Enlightenment's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get
     all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came
     with the distribution.

Compilers and Options
=====================

   Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
the `configure' script does not know about.  You can give `configure'
initial values for variables by setting them in the environment.  Using
a Bourne-compatible shell, you can do that on the command line like
this:
     CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix ./configure

Or on systems that have the `env' program, you can do it like this:
     env CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-s ./configure

Compiling For Multiple Architectures
====================================

   You can compile Enlightenment for more than one kind of computer at the
same time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their
own directory.  To do this, you must use a version of `make' that
supports the `VPATH' variable, such as GNU `make'.  `cd' to the
directory where you want the object files and executables to go and run
the `configure' script.  `configure' automatically checks for the
source code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.

   If you have to use a `make' that does not supports the `VPATH'
variable, you have to compile Enlightenment for one architecture at a time
in the source code directory.  After you have installed Enlightenment for
one architecture, use `make distclean' before reconfiguring for another
architecture.

Installation Names
==================

   By default, `make install' will install Enlightenment's files in
`/usr/local/enlightenment/bin', `/usr/local/man', etc.  You can specify an
installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving `configure' the
option `--prefix=PATH'.

   Enlightenment, by default, will place all of its files in a subdirectory of
the prefix that you supply named "enlightenment" - this breaks the fsstd.  If
you are a diehard fsstd fan, you can override this by using the
`--enable-fsstd' option on your configure line.

   You can specify separate installation prefixes for
architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you
give `configure' the option `--exec-prefix=PATH', Enlightenment will use
PATH as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
Documentation and other data files will still use the regular prefix.


Optional Features
=================

   Some packages pay attention to `--enable-FEATURE' options to
`configure', where FEATURE indicates an optional part of Enlightenment.
They may also pay attention to `--with-PACKAGE' options, where PACKAGE
is something like `gnu-as' or `x' (for the X Window System).

   `configure' can usually find the X include and library files automatically,
but if it doesn't, you can use the `configure' options `--x-includes=DIR' and
`--x-libraries=DIR' to specify their locations.

   You can choose to enable and/or disable sound at compiletime by using
`--enable-sound=[yes|no]' - if you choose to enable sound, you should download
the latest versions of esound and libaudiofile.  Information on these packages
can be retreived at http://www.gnome.org

Specifying the System Type
==========================

   There may be some features `configure' can not figure out
automatically, but needs to determine by the type of host Enlightenment
will run on.  Usually `configure' can figure that out, but if it prints
a message saying it can not guess the host type, give it the
`--host=TYPE' option.  TYPE can either be a short name for the system
type, such as `sun4', or a canonical name with three fields:
     CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM

See the file `config.sub' for the possible values of each field.  If
`config.sub' isn't included in this package, then this package doesn't
need to know the host type.

   If you are building compiler tools for cross-compiling, you can also
use the `--target=TYPE' option to select the type of system they will
produce code for and the `--build=TYPE' option to select the type of
system on which you are compiling Enlightenment.

Sharing Defaults
================

   If you want to set default values for `configure' scripts to share,
you can create a site shell script called `config.site' that gives
default values for variables like `CC', `cache_file', and `prefix'.
`configure' looks for `PREFIX/share/config.site' if it exists, then
`PREFIX/etc/config.site' if it exists.  Or, you can set the
`CONFIG_SITE' environment variable to the location of the site script.
A warning: not all `configure' scripts look for a site script.

Operation Controls
==================

   `configure' recognizes the following options to control how it
operates.

`--cache-file=FILE'
     Use and save the results of the tests in FILE instead of
     `./config.cache'.  Set FILE to `/dev/null' to disable caching, for
     debugging `configure'.

`--help'
     Print a summary of the options to `configure', and exit.

`--quiet'
`--silent'
`-q'
     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.  To
     suppress all normal output, redirect it to `/dev/null' (any error
     messages will still be shown).

`--srcdir=DIR'
     Look for Enlightenment's source code in directory DIR.  Usually
     `configure' can determine that directory automatically.

`--version'
     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'
     script, and exit.
`--enable-fsstd'
     Install Enlightenment in what is considered to be the "filing system
     standard" way. This means binaries will be put in /usr/local/bin
     or /usr/bin (PREFIX/bin) and data files in /usr/local/share/enlightenment
     or /usr/share/enlightenment (PREFIX/share/enlightenment), instead of the
     default where Enlightenemnt installs all files in /usr/local/enlightenment
     (PREFIX/enlightenment).
`--prefix=PREFIX'
     Set the install prefix to PREFIX. By befault this prefix is /usr/local
     but you may change it (for example for many distribtuions you may wish to
     use /usr as your prefix).
`configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.

Setting Up Enlightenment For My User
====================================

Hopefully by now, you've gotten Enlightenment compiled and installed on your
system.  In order to set up Enlightenment to act as your primary window
manager, you'll need to edit some files.  If you start X from the commandline
(typically using a command like `startx') look for a file in your home
directory called `.xinitrc'.  If you start X from a graphical login manager,
look in your home directory for a file called `.xsession'.  If you can't find
these files, that's okay, you can create a new one.  Open up the appropriate
file.

If you have a pre-existing file, look for the line that looks something like
this:

exec fvwm

It should be the last line in the file.  Replace this line with something that
looks like this:

exec /usr/local/enlightenment/bin/enlightenment

(where /usr/local/enlightenment is where you installed the source -- this is
the default location... if you used --enable-fsstd it would be /usr/local/bin)

If you had no file, just create one with that information in it.
That's all we have to do to these files!  Just save and quit the file.
Once you've done that, make sure you've made the file executable (some systems
require this).  You can do this by simply running

`chmod +x .xsession'
or
`chmod +x .xinitrc'

And then we're done!  The next time you start up X as your user, you should be
in Enlightenment!

http://www.enlightenment.org/mail.html for more details.

Window Manager Hints
====================

For compatibility with environments supporting the Extended Window Manager 
Hints (see http://www.freedesktop.org/) such as GNOME2 and KDE2/3, configure
with --enable-hints-ewmh (default).

For compatibility with GNOME versions prior to 2.0, configure with 
--enable-hints-gnome and read the section about GNOME below.


Setting Up Enlightenment To Work with GNOME versions prior to 2.0
=================================================================

By default, Enlightenment supports all of the GNOME hints.  However, if you
want to run GMC you may notice that clicking on the root window does not
always have the desired effect (for dragging icons, GMC's root menus, etc).
If you want to use GMC with enlightenment, there are a couple of options.  You
can use alt+leftmouse and alt+rightmouse to use the GMC root menus.  Or, you
can edit the keybindings.cfg file to remove the bindings for your left and right
mousebuttons.  There is a copy of keybindings.cfg that will do this for you
that comes with enlightenment.  in /path/to/enlightenment/configs/
copy the keybindings.gmc.cfg into your ~/.enlightenment directory, and then
rename the keybindings.gmc.cfg file to keybindings.cfg.  When you
restart, you will no longer have the left and right mousebuttons bound to
enlightenment.  To modify your system configuration, copy over the
keybindings.cfg file in that directory.  For your convenience, there is a
keybindings.nogmc.cfg in case you want to reverse this change at a later date.
NOTE: you may choose to use virtual areas instead of virtual desktops since
GMC does not handle clicks anywhere on the root window on desktops other than
0.
If you want to start enlightenment from gnome-session, you should use the
gnome control-panel to select the new enlightenment as your window manager.
Warning: Enlightenment is slower when run from a session manager.  You should
opt to run enlightenment and have enlightenment be your session manager
instead of running gnome-session.  You can start "panel" and "gmc" by hand and
have enlightenment relaunch them as the preferred launch method.  To do this,
once you have launched them by hand, alt-rightclick on them, select "Remember"
and then choose "Restart Application on Login".
