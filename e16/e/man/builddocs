XFrequently Asked Questions
X
XWelcome to the Enlightenment Documentation Viewer.  Please select a topic from
Xthe list.
X
XThis Documentation is intended to take you step by step through Enlightenment
Xand its default setup, how to use it, modify settings, and put it to use for
Xyou. When you have finished reading each page please press the NEXT button on
Xthe top of this window to go to the next page, or use the Back button until you have reached the Docs Index
X
XIf you are reading this right now you have managed to get Enlightenment itself
Xinstalled correctly and are either running Enlightenment for the first time or
Xhave just upgraded to a new version. Congratulations. Now it's time to take
Xyou on a quick tour of the desktop you will have before you.
X
XPlease remember that if you use a theme other than the default
X(Brushed Metal) that it may look slightly or completely different to the
Xcontents of this User Documenation. Some behavior may also vary.
X
XTo relaunch this Help Browser at any time, middle click on your
Xdesktop and select the "Help" Item.  The documentation should come
Xback up, reloading to the first page.
XYou can also use the "Home" key to take you back to the introduction page at
Xany time during the program.
X
XEnlightenment is your Window Manager. The Window Manager controls the
Xappearance of the borders of your windows, their behavior and
Xall user interaction with positioning, killing, resizing, moving, iconifying,
Xshading etc. your windows, virtual desktops, multiple desktops, menus attached
Xto windows and some root window menus and can also control the background
Xof your desktop(s).
X
XEnlightenment is a large and complex program and is by no means perfect,
Xbut it is being worked on and is as stable as possible. It has many advanced
Xfeatures, but may also be missing some features that you would like to see.
XThe version you are now running (0.16.0) is by no means the
Xend of development and improvements, fixes and new exciting features are
Xbeing worked on all the time. Please visit the
X
XWeb site often for
Xnew versions, fixes, patches and updates.
X
XWe hope that you enjoy using Enlightenment as much as we have enjoyed writing
Xit.  We'd like to think that even if this isn't the right software for you, you
Xat least can have fun playing around with what we have created.

X
XA big thanks to several companies that helped support Enlightenment.
X
XRed Hat Software (www.redhat.com) for allowing developers resources and time
Xto work on Enlightenment.
X
XVA Linux Systems (www.valinux.com) for providing hardware, bandwidth, Coke, and
Xthe patience to hire a couple of loony bin candidates to work on something we
X(and hopefully you) think is interesting.
X
XXi Graphics (www.xig.com) for providing X servers to test out code on.
X
XNot only should these people be thanked, but the whole E community - those on
Xthe E mailing list, on #E on IRC on EFnet and all E users who have provided
Xfeedback and debugging information, bug-fixes, patches and support. A big
Xthanks goes out to all of you who make a project like this possible.
X
XIn addition we'd like to thank several other projects - such
Xas XFree86, Imlib, Esound, Freetype and many others, The people working on
Xthese equally important projects should not be forgotten.
X
XFor updated information on Enlightenment, development, bug-fixes, snapshots of
Xdevelopment versions etc. please visit:
X
Xhttp://www.enlightenment.org/
X
XYou may want to visit this site often as it changes
Xregularly with fixes and development releases -- also visiting the
Xdaily-snapshots section
Xon the FTP site is a good idea (see the snapshots section on the website for
Xmore information).
X
XThere is an Official Enlightenment IRC channel where you can go and "hang out"
Xif you want - talk to other E users, developers, get some help, drool
Xtogether, or whatever. #E will kill me for this but get onto any EFnet irc
Xserver (irc.efnet.org) then join #E. For example:
X
XBitchX your_nick irc.efnet.org
X
Xor
X
Xirc your_nick irc.efnet.org
X
Xor use your favorite graphical IRC client.
X
XPlease remember that it can get busy with 100's of people talking at once.
XNot everyone is actually listening all the time or are in the middle of a
Xconversation. Be polite and patient, and have a sense of humor and you'll
Xhave fun.

XMaintenance Scripts
X
XNow that you have started Enlightenment, if you are using it for your desktop
Xshell, your screen should look something like the image here on the left.
X
XAcross the whole top of the screen you will see a bar with arrows pointing
Xup and down on the left and right ends. This is your desktop
XDragbar .
X
XOn the bottom-left you'll see 3 boxes. The top box with the scrollbar attached
Xwill be your Iconbox.
X
XThe other 2 boxes below it are Pagers for desktops 0 and 1. Everything
Xelse is your desktop background.
X
X=head1 Using Menus
X
XWhen you click with your left mouse button on the desktop background you will
Xsee an "User Menus" menu appear (example displayed on the right here).
XApplications you may have installed will appear in this menu. To launch one
Xof them simply select it from the menu.
X
XNote: Menus in Enlightenment work like most menu systems. Either hold
Xdown the mouse button and navigate with the button down, releasing on the
Xselection you want, or release elsewhere to not select anything. You can also
Xquickly click and release, then navigate: move the mouse, and click
Xagain on the item you wish to select, or elsewhere if you do not wish to
Xselect an entry.
X
XTo "stick" a menu up and leave it up so you can select items from
Xit multiple times, click and hold down the mouse and release on the title of
Xthe menu (if it has one) and it will remain up. You can move it and
Xmanipulate it like a normal window. Close the window to unstick the menu.
X
XClicking the middle button on the desktop background will display
XEnlightenment's main menu. You can access the other menus plus more options
Xfrom this menu (including those to log out, restart and display Help
Xinformation). A sample of this menu is shown to our left.
X
XWhen you click the right mouse button
Xa menu with the title "Settings" will appear. This is
XEnlightenment's settings menu. From it you can select various
Xconfiguration dialogs that will assist you in customizing your desktop to
Xbetter suit your needs.
X
X=head1 Mouse Bindings
X
XOf course, when you click on the desktop background of
Xyour screen, normally you will bring up a menu.  And of course, when you
Xclick on the border of a window, you will do various things.  But these
Xare not the only things you can do with your mouse.
X
XIn Enlightenment, there are several other actions that the mouse can do by
Xdefault.  For example, by holding down the ALT key when you click the left
Xmouse button anywhere in a window, you will find that you can move the window
Xaround the screen, just as if you had used the titlebar.  You can also ALT
Xmiddle-click in a window to resize it, or use ALT and right-click to bring up
Xthe Window Operations Menu.
X
XYou will find that holding down the ALT key while clicking the middle
Xmouse button on the background of your desktop will bring up a
Xmenu with the titles of all currently active
Xapplication windows. Selecting one of these will take you to that application.
XBy using the CTRL key instead of ALT you will get a menu displaying all
Xcurrent desktops as sub-menus, with applications on each desktop in the
Xdesktop sub-menu.
X
X=head1 Mouse Configuration
X
XEnlightenment makes extensive use of the mouse.
XHowever, you may be missing some features because of the way
Xthat your mouse is configured on your X server.
X
XIf your mouse does not have a middle button you should enable
X"Emulate 3 Buttons" in your X server. This option allows you to
Xemulate a three-button mouse by pressing both left and
Xright mouse buttons at once.
XIf this does not work, three-button emulation  may not be enabled. See
Xyour X server documentation to configure this emulation.
X
XThis may vary from system to system. The OS and X server may also
Xvary the method in which you do this, if it is possible. Not having
Xa middle mouse button in
XEnlightenment, or for that matter X, is not a good thing as it is almost
Xassumed to be there, and is used by many applications, including E.
X
XIf you have a Wheel-Mouse and X is configured to use it, Enlightenment
Xsupports it by default.
X
XRolling your wheel up on the desktop background will take you back a
Xdesktop . Rolling your wheel downward you will advance
Xforward a desktop.
X
XIf this doesn't work, then it may be you haven't configured your X server to
Xunderstand a mouse with a wheel. If you use XFree86 you may need to edit your
XXF86Config to have a "Pointer" Section like:
X
X    Section "Pointer"
X    Protocol    "MousemanPlusPS/2"
X    Device      "/dev/mouse"
X    ZAxisMapping 4 5
X    Buttons      5
X    EndSection
X
XYou may need to modify this for your mouse.
X
X=head1 Using the Window Border
X
XWhen you start an application, unless it has special properties, it will come
Xup on your screen with a border surrounding it that contains a titlebar and
Xseveral control buttons.
XThis border is the primary interface to controlling an application window.
XThe Default setup (shown on the next page) gives adequate control but still
Xretains simplicity.
X
XIf you click left mouse button on the titlebar and keep the mouse button down
Xthe window will follow your mouse wherever it moves. Respectively if you click
Xyour left mouse button and drag on any of the resize handles, the window will
Xbe resized in that direction. Clicking right mouse button on the resize
Xhandles will raise the windows to the top.
X
XClicking right mouse button on the titlebar or any button on the window
Xoperations menu button on the top-left will display a menu that has window
Xmanipulation options in it.
X
XDouble-Clicking (clicking the mouse twice in succession really fast) will
Xmake the Window shade or unshade (depending if it was unshaded or shaded to
Xstart with).
X
XClicking left mouse button on the iconify button will iconify the window
Xand send it off to the Iconbox . Hitting the Maximize button will
Xmaximize the
Xsize of the application fill your screen. Hitting it again will Unmaximize,
Xbringing the window back to its normal size.
X
XClicking with the left mouse button on the close button will close the window.
XIf the application that owns that window does not respond to a nice request to
Xexit, then press the right mouse button on the close button to forcibly
Xterminate that window. This should not be used unless the application is
Xvisibly "hung".
X
XIn addition to these methods, there are additional ways to manipulation
Xwindows.
X
XIf you hold down the ALT key and hold down left mouse button anywhere in the
Xwindow (on the border OR in the application part) while dragging, you will
Xmove this window around. Doing the same but with the middle mouse button will
Xresize the window in that direction. Clicking the right mouse button anywhere
Xin the window while holding down the ALT key will bring up the window
Xoperations menu.
X
X=head1 Changing Window Borders
X
XFrom time to time you may find that you don't like a particular border that a
Xwindow uses, for some reason or another.  You can easily change the border
Xstyle of a window in Enlightenment using the
X
XWindow Operations
Xmenu, however.  Select the "Set Border Style" menu, and a list will be
Xpresented to you of available borders in this theme.  The most common use
Xfor this is to make an application shed its border, using the
XBORDERLESS border type.
X
XYou can always click with ALT + Right mouse button anywhere in the window to
Xbring up the window operations menu again.
X
XIf you want to remember the border style for the next time you run this
Xapplication, you can always use the Remember dialog to remember
Xthe current window border.
X
X=head1 Default Keybindings
X
XBelow are the keybindings for E as it comes "from the factory"
X
XCTRL+ALT+Home - Re-shuffle windows on screen to be Clean
X
XCTRL+ALT+Del - Exit Enlightenment and Log Out
X
XCTRL+ALT+End - Restart Enlightenment
X
XCTRL+ALT+Up-Arrow - Raise window to top
X
XCTRL+ALT+Down-Arrow - Lower window to the bottom
X
XCTRL+ALT+Left-Arrow - Go to the previous desktop
X
XCTRL+ALT+Right-Arrow - Go to the next desktop
X
XCTRL+ALT+X - Close the currently focused window
X
XCTRL+ALT+K - Kill the currently focused window nastily
X
XCTRL+ALT+R - Shade/Unshade the currently focused window
X
XCTRL+ALT+I - Iconify the currently focused window
X
XCTRL+ALT+R - Shade/Unshade the currently focused window
X
XCTRL+ALT+S - Stick/Unstick the currently focused window
X
XCTRL+ALT+(F1 - F12) - Go directly to desktops 0 - 11
X
XALT+Tab - Switch focus to the next window
X
XALT+Enter - Zoom/Unzoom the currently focused window
X
XSHIFT+ALT+Left-Arrow - Move to the virtual desktop on the left if there is one
X
XSHIFT+ALT+Right-Arrow - Move to the virtual desktop on the right if there is
Xone
X
XSHIFT+ALT+Up-Arrow - Move to the virtual desktop above if there is one
X
XSHIFT+ALT+Down-Arrow - Move to the virtual desktop below if there is one
X
XNote: Zooming in and out of windows will only work if you have an XFree86
Xserver or one that implements the Xf86VidMode extension. You also need
Xto define lots of screen modes for your display, so ensure your "Display"
Xsubsection of your XF86Config looks like:
X
X    SubSection "Display"
X    	Depth 16
X    	Modes "1600x1200" "1280x1024" "1152x864" "1024x768" "800x600" "640x480" "512x384" "400x300" "320x240"
X    EndSubSection
X
XHave a "Display" subsection per depth (this example is for 16 bit) and all
Xthe resolutions defined as above.
X
X=head1 Multiple & Virtual Desktops
X
XEnlightenment supports both Multiple and Virtual desktops. There are
Xdistinct difference between the two, and Enlightenment treats them differently.
X
XWhen you start Enlightenment you will by default have two desktops. In
XEnlightenment desktops are geometrically unrelated work areas. They are
Xvisually stacked on top of each other and can even be dragged down to expose
Xdesktops underneath.
X
XThe best way to imagine this is that each desktop is a sheet of paper with the
Xfirst desktop (desktop 0) being glued in-place. You can re-shuffle the stack
Xof papers and slide one down to reveal a piece of paper underneath - the only
Xpaper you can't slide is the first one. Each desktop (or sheet) contains your
Xapplication windows.
X
XWindows normally live on one desktop, but can be made
Xto exist on all desktops - whenever you change to a new desktop the window
Xwill follow you and be on that desktop too. This is known as being sticky.
Xif a window is sticky it will "stick to the glass of your screen" and stay
Xthere until it is not sticky anymore or the window is closed.
X
XVirtual desktops (also known as desktop areas) is a measure of how big your
Xdesktops are. A desktop can be a multiple of your screen size in size (2x1,
X2x2, 3x3, 4x2 etc.). That means each desktop has an AxB screen size of area
Xallocated to it and you can be looking at any screen-sized part of it at any
Xtime. It's just like getting more sheets of paper and taping them to the sides
Xof your current sheet of paper. An easy way of changing your view is by just
Xsliding your mouse in the direction of a currently unviewable part of your
Xdesktop. As long as you have Edge Flip enabled Enlightenment will
Xautomatically scroll over to that part of the desktop.
X
XTo change the number of virtual desktops that you have, use the "Multiple
XDesktop Settings" dialog from the right mouse settings menu .  You
Xshould see a menu that looks something like the menu to the right.  You can use
Xthe slider bar to quickly select the appropriate number of virtual desktops you
Xwould like to use.
X
XTo change the number of virtual areas, use the "Virtual Desktop Settings"
Xmenu.  This will bring up a menu that looks something like the one on the left.
XUse the slider bars to extend the size of the virtual areas to the size that
Xyou prefer. You can also use this dialog to enable/disable edge
Xresistance (when your mouse hits the edge of an area) moving between
Xvirtual areas.
X
XEnlightenment also allows you to set a different desktop backdrop per desktop
Xto help you customize your environment and differentiate which desktop is
Xwhich.
X
XAn easy way of having Enlightenment automatically pick up any pictures you have
Xis to make a directory in your ~/.enlightenment directory called
Xbackgrounds and then fill that with your favorite backdrops. Enlightenment
Xwill automatically discover this and index them for you allowing you to
Xselect them and change their settings. More on this topic is explained in the
XDesktop Backgrounds section.
X
X=head1 Changing Desktops
X
XThere are several ways that you can change your current desktop - let's go over
Xa few of them here.
X
XYou can use the Keybindings alt-F1 through alt-F12 for the first 12
Xdesktops.
XYou can use the Keybindings Ctrl-Alt-Left and Ctrl-Alt-Right to
Xnavigate to the next/previous desktop.
XYou can use the Keybindings shift-alt-directional arrow to change
Xvirtual areas in a given direction.
XYou can use the Pager to quickly navigate to the desktop/area you want
Xby clicking on the desired area.
XYou can use the Dragbar to quickly navigate to a particular
Xapplication or a particular desktop by using the middle and right mouse
Xbuttons.
XYou can also use external applications such as the GNOME panel's pager or the
XKDE panel's pager to navigate desktops and/or applications.  You will need to
Xenable Desktop Support for these to work.
X
X=head1 Moving Applications Between Desktops
X
XThere are several ways that you can move applications from one desktop to
Xanother.  We'll go over a few of them now.
X
XThe first way you can move apps between desktops is using the Pager.
X
XYou can also move applications between desktops using the
XDragbar.
X
XYou can also move applications between desktops using the
XKDE or GNOME desktop pagers.
X
XYou can also move a window, then bring the window with you as you
Xchange desktops using keybinding.
X
X=head1 The Dragbar
X
XIf you look along the top of your screen, you will notice a long thin bar that
Xlooks something like the bar pictured below.  This is called your Dragbar.  It
Xgets its name from its primary purpose, which is dragging desktops around.
X
XIf
Xyou are on any desktop except desktop 0, you can pick up and move that desktop
Xin another direction.  Desktops documentation has more information
Xon how to change desktops.  Once you have dragged a desktop down, you can
Xproceed to move windows between desktops this way, instead of using the
Xpager.
X
XYou can also use the Dragbar to retrieve windowlists.  Use the middle mouse
Xbutton to retrieve a windowlist, and the right mouse button for a
Xwindowlist sorted by desktops.
X
X=head1 The Pager
X
XPagers may not be a new idea in desktop environments, but the Pager in
XEnlightenment (as seen on the right) is a highly advanced and highly
Xconfigurable tool for desktop and window control, as well as a navigation tool.
X
XThe pager lets you see your desktop screen area in miniature. It lets you click
Xon a certain desktop to "visit" it, click and drag windows around in the pager
Xitself to move them about the screen quickly, or between desktops. In this example, we have two virtual areas.  You can see the current area (the
Xone with the windows in it) is also highlighted.
X
XDragging a window from
Xone area of a pager to another will move it there, or to another desktop.
XDragging it out onto the actual desktop will drop that window right there.
XYou can also drag a window into the Iconbox to iconify the window.
X
XPressing right-mouse button over a blank portion of the pager gets you the
Xpager menu, allowing you to change settings.  This will allow you to
Xset a couple of quick options, as shown on the left.  For more available
Xoptions, you can select the "Pager Settings" item, and another dialog will pop
Xup, that looks like the one below.
X
XThis dialog box will allow you to set all sorts of additional parameters, many
Xof which can increase the performance of Enlightenment on your system.
XDisabling high quality snapshots and/or snapshots in general as well as
Xcontinuous updates can seriously improve performance - these features are
Xintended for high end machines.
X
XYou can resize the pager to make it the size you'd like.  Hold down
XALT and use the middle-mouse button to resize the pager in any direction. Using
Xleft-mouse button while holding ALT and dragging will move the window. Holding
Xdown ALT while pressing right-mouse button, just like any normal window will
Xget you a window operations menu.
X
XIn the default theme clicking the tab on the right side of the pager with the
Xarrow pointing right will shade and unshade the pager window horizontally,
Xallowing you to hide and unhide the window easily.
X
XThe striped area above this tab on the pager's border is a handle that will
Xallow you to move the pager about, just like the titlebar of any window.
X
X=head1 The Iconbox
X
XThe iconbox is the place the icons for all your iconified windows go.  It is
Xone method of recovering minimized applications.  Whenever
Xyou iconify or minimize a window it will go into an iconbox and have an icon
Xdisplayed for it there. Clicking on the icon again will de-iconify it.
X
XYou can have as many icon boxes on your desktop as you want to.  You can create
Xmore by using the Middle Click Menu - select Desktop->Create New Iconbox
Xand a new Iconbox will pop up on your desktop.  Each of these Iconboxes can
Xhave individual configurations, as detailed on the next page.
X
XYou can move the Iconbox around the screen using Alt-Leftclick
Xon the window, and then moving it to the desired location on the screen.  You
Xcan resize the Iconbox by alt-middleclicking on the window and
Xthen adjusting the size  as described in the Mouse Bindings
Xsection.
X
XClicking the right-mouse button anywhere in the Iconbox will bring up a menu
Xto configure that iconbox.  This menu will look a little something like the one
Xhere to the right.  This menu allows you to also close the Iconbox or open up
Xan additional Iconbox.
X
XTo change the settings of an individual Iconbox, we'll use the right mouse
Xbutton menu and select "This
XIconbox Settings" - this should get us a dialog that looks something like the
Xone  to our left.  You can change the orientation, icon size, scrollbar
Xoptions, display policy, base image, and many more options of the Iconbox
Xfrom this dialog.  You may choose to change the anchor of
Xalignment for resizes - play with it until it resizes appropriately for your
XIconbox location.
X
XIf you want to customize the images used for the icons in your iconbox, there
Xis already an example configuration supplied. To make your own configuration
Xcopy the icondefs.cfg file installed in your Enlightenment system config
Xdirectory (/usr/local/enlightenment/config/icondefs.cfg or
X/usr/share/enlightenment/config/icondefs.cfg) to your ~/.enlightenment
Xdirectory and then edit it. On each line you will find 4 fields. The first
Xfield is the image file to be used. The image is searched for in the usual
Xsearch path if it is not an absolute path to the image file. The search path
Xis in order: ~/.enlightenment, THEME_DIR/, ENLIGHTENMENT_ROOT/config.
X
XThe second field on the line is a shell-glob like match for the title of
Xa window.
XIf this field is irrelevant, NULL is used instead. NB: the only valid wildcard
Xin the glob pattern is "*". The third field is the NAME property of the window
Xand the fourth is the CLASS. The order of search priority is last to first,
Xso the last entry in the file that matches a window's title, name and class
Xglobs will use the icon image defined on the first line.
X
XIf you want all windows to have an icon then use:
X
X"pix/pimage.png" NULL NULL NULL
X
XThis is the most general match for an icon and will match ALL windows. If you
Xuse this make sure it's at the start of the file so it will only match if no
Xother matches are found.
X
XThere are several examples of using the globbing and matching in the system
Xicondefs.cfg file. Use that as a reference for your own additions.
X
X=head1 Recovering Minimized Applications
X
XThere are several ways to recover an application once you have minimized it.
XThe most obvious way is to use the
XIconbox .  Of course, you might
Xhave had some applications in your Iconbox when you accidentally closed it.  Or
Xmaybe you minimized some applications and forgot you didn't have an Iconbox.
XOr maybe you don't like the Iconbox and usually use KDE or GNOME's panel to
Xrecover them and forgot to launch them.  Never fear.  You can always
Xmiddle click on the Dragbar
Xand get a menu that will allow you
Xto recover them.  You can also Alt or Ctrl-Middleclick on the desktop to get
Xthe same menus (in case you don't have a Dragbar anymore).
X
XRemember, at any time you can always create a new Iconbox to catch
Xyour applications as they minimize, if you want to re-enable it.  Unfortunately
Xyou'll have to reconfigure it since each Iconbox can have its own
Xsettings.
X
X=head1 Remembering Application Properties
X
XIn the window operations menu of every window you will see an
Xentry labeled
X"Remember...". If you select this it will bring up the "Remember" dialog for
Xthat window (Note: only one of these dialogs can be active at any one time), as
Xshown to our right.
X
XThis dialog lets you selectively snapshot certain attributes of that window at
Xthat time and have Enlightenment remember them. You may choose to only remember
Xsome of the attributes, and possibly not have the application started
Xautomatically for you. Choose what you want Enlightenment to remember about that
Xwindow and hit "Apply" or "OK" if you don't need the dialog anymore, and
XEnlightenment will, the next time that instance of the application is run,
Xapply the current location, size, border style or any other attribute to
Xthat window. Enlightenment can also launch the application for you upon startup
Xif you so wish.
X
X=head1 Settings
X
XWhen you click the right mouse button on the desktop background you will pop
Xup the Settings menu. From here you can select an aspect of Enlightenment to
Xconfigure to your liking. There are too many settings to actually document
Xfully right now, but the likelihood is if you want a particular behavior from
XEnlightenment, it is achievable by merely playing with these options.
X
XCombinations of options are often required to get the effect you want, so some
Xexperimentation may be required. Do not be frightened. Nothing you can do
Xcan't be undone by simply changing the options back to how they were and
Xclicking on Apply again.
X
X=head1 Window Groups
X
XSometimes you have a number of windows on your desktop that logically go
Xtogether. Enlightenment allows you to group windows
Xtogether, so that whenever you change a property of one window in a group,
Xthe change is reflected on the other group members. If you have a group whose
Xmembers span multiple desktops , changing a group's property
Xaffects only windows of that group that are on the current desktop.
X
XThe properties that you can change for an entire group include setting the window
Xborder, iconifying, killing, moving, raising/lowering, sticking and shading of
Xa window.
X
XTo define what properties are applied to a group by default, you go to the
Xsettings menu and pick the "Group Settings" option, which will give
Xyou a dialog window in which you can configure the settings, as shown here on
Xthe right.
X
XThere are two different methods for manipulating window groups. First, there's a
Xcomprehensive submenu available in each window's operations menu
Xcalled "Window Groups".  This menu is shown here on the right.  You also are
Xable to configure the group individually apart from the default group settings
X(as shown on the previous page).
X
XThe second way is the window titlebar, which has the most important options
Xdirectly available for convenience. Shift-click to start a group,
XCtrl-clicking to add a window to the youngest group (also referred to as the
X"current" group) and Shift-Ctrl-Click to destroying a group. You can also click
Xthe middle mouse button for visualizing the group(s) of a window. Click again
Xto returning to the previous border.
X
XWindows can be in multiple groups at the same time, so for many
Xoptions you have to indicate which group you are referring to.
XSelecting the appropriate checkboxes (showing the group members' titles)
Xat the top of the dialog windows.
X
X=head1 Selecting and Adding backgrounds
X
XOften you will want to change the background of a particular desktop.  There
Xare several ways you can do this.  But of course, to change your desktop,
Xyou'll need to give Enlightenment some graphics to play with.  A desktop
Xtheme may add a background or two to your available selections, but
Xmost users want to have even backgrounds to choose from.  To add backgrounds to your
Xselection, make a backgrounds directory under your home directory.  To
Xdo this using most shells you can type
X
Xmkdir ~/.enlightenment/backgrounds
X
XOnce you've done this, you should restart Enlightenment - this can be done
Xquickly and easily by simply hitting the Ctrl-Alt-End key combination.  When
XEnlightenment starts up, it will rescan these directories, and add new files
Xinto the background selector.
X
XOnce you have added your backgrounds and restarted Enlightenment, you should be
Xable to go to the root menu desktop selector.  To get to this menu, middle
Xclick on the desktop, select "Desktop",
Xand go to Backgrounds.  You should get something that looks similar to the
Ximage  on the right.  From here you will be able to navigate the backgrounds
Xmenus.
X
X(Click next for more information)
X
XOnce you have opened up the backgrounds menu, you should see something similar
Xto the image below.  From here, you can put your mouse over any of the images
Xthere, and it will change the desktop background of the current desktop to the
Ximage that you have selected.
X
XEnlightenment will attempt to choose the best
Xsettings for a particular background, but if it gets it wrong you can always
Xchange the settings by hand.  By bringing up the settings menu with the right
Xmouse button and selecting the "Desktop Background Settings" item, you can
Xbring up a dialog that looks something like the one on the next page . ..
X
XYou can use this dialog to change your background, too , as well as fine-tune
Xall the various settings for each individual background available.
X
X=head1 Tooltips
X
XFrom time to time, as you use Enlightenment, if you don't remember what does
Xwhat, if you keep the mouse still for a little bit a tooltip will pop up.  The
Xeasiest example of this is when you hold the mouse over a Window Border.
X
XYou can disable the tooltips or change the delay before they pop up by
Xselecting the "Tooltip Settings" dialog from the settings menu, as
Xshown here on the left.
X
X=head1 Audio
X
XOf course, Enlightenment comes preconfigured to play lots of little blips and
Xbeeps when you do various things on your desktop.  In order to use sound in
XEnlightenment, you must have both ESounD and audiofile installed.  You can find
Xmore information about these libraries from http://www.gnome.org.
X
XYou can enable and/or disable sound at runtime simply by selecting from the
XSettings menu the "Audio Settings" option, which brings up a dialog,
Xshown here at right.
X
X=head1 Special Effects
X
XEnlightenment has many features that are configured via the "Special FX"
Xsettings dialog.  Here you can configure the Dragbar ,
Xvarious sliding speeds (including the speed of a windowshade), as well as
Xtoggle animation of different features.  You can also configure the method used
Xfor sliding windows, similar to
Xresize modes .
X
XThere are several FX features disabled by default
Xin a new installation, including the animated display of menus.  You can also
Xenable saveunders here, which may improve or slow down the performance of
XEnlightenment on your X server, depending on server and configuration.
X
X=head1 Setting the Focus
X
XEnlightenment offers lots of different options for focusing windows.  By
Xdefault, it comes up in sloppy focus mode.  There are two other primary focus
Xmodes supported by Enlightenment - click to focus and pointer focus.
X
XClick To Focus most people are familiar with.  You click on a window and it
Xreceives the focus from Enlightenment.
X
XPointer Focus gives the focus to whichever window the pointer is sitting over
X
XSloppy Focus is similar to Pointer Focus, except that if you go over the
Xdesktop background you still are focused on the last window
X
XNext we'll tell you how to change these settings.
X
XEnlightenment allows you to change your focus settings at any time.  Simply
Xbring up the Settings menu and then select "Focus Settings" to bring
Xup a dialog that looks something like the one on the right.  At the top, we can
Xselect between our three focus modes, as described on the previous page.
X
XWe can also enable some other features, such as one that will allow a simple
Xmouse click to raise any window to the foreground, as well as several
Xother advanced focus settings.
X
XHere we can also enable the focuslist feature.  This feature requires Xkb to be
Xenabled in your X server.  If you don't have Xkb enabled, please consult your X
Xserver documentation to see how to do this.  The focuslist is a
Xwindow list that pops up
Xas you cycle through your focus using the ALT + TAB
XKeybinding.
X
X=head1 Moving Windows
X
XEnlightenment comes with several different available methods for moving a
Xwindow.  You can perform the actual moves using the  Window
X
XBorder, or by using the available
X
XMouse Bindings .  This will cause the window to move until you have
Xreleased the mouse button.
X
XTo change the mode that the moving of the windows uses (opaque being the
Xdefault), open up the Settings menu, and select "Move & Resize
XSettings".  You can select from a list that looks similar to the one here
Xabove-right.  Experiment until you find one that suits you best.
X
XFor some serious eyecandy, try out the Translucent move mode.  This will only
Xwork if your X server and Enlightenment are running on the same machine,
Xhowever.
X
X=head1 Resizing Windows
X
XEnlightenment also comes with several available methods for resizing windows.
XYou can perform the actual resize on the window by clicking on any
Xresize-handle of your window border and dragging to the desired size.
XYou can also get the same effect by using the ALT + middle button
Xmouse binding in any part of the window.
X
XTo change the mode that the resizing of the windows uses (opaque being the
Xdefault), open up the Settings menu, and select "Move & Resize
XSettings".  You can select from a list that looks similar to the one here
Xabove-right.  Experiment until you find one that suits you best.
X
XThe best eyecandy resize mode is probably technical move mode.  This mode shows
Xyou the height and width of the window, in addition to the distance from the
Xnearest edge.
X
X=head1 The Window Operations Menu
X
XThe Window Operations menu is a commonly used menu that allows you to perform
Xmany different actions onto the current window.
X
XThe Close function closes the window in question.
XAnnihilate destroys the window without
Xregard to the application the window belongs to, which is especially useful if
Xthe application refuses to respond to being closed with Close.
X
XThe Iconify function iconifies the window.
XIf you have an
X
XIconbox
Xit is sent to the nearest one.
X
XThe Raise function raises the window above any windows
Xthat may be obscuring it and Lower
Xlowers it below windows it is obscuring.
X
XMore on the next page.
X
XShade/Unshade toggles the shaded state of the window. Note that borderless
Xwindows are not allowed to be shaded.
X
XStick/Unstick toggles the sticky state of a window. A window that is sticky
Xremains "stuck to the glass" and thus is visible on all virtual and
Xmultiple desktops.
X
XFullscreen/Window zooms in and out of the window changing resolutions
Xif possible. This feature will only work if you have your X server configured
Xcorrectly and it supports the XVidtune extension. Your X server may not like
Xhaving resolutions changed - it is possible that an unstable X server could
Xcrash if you use this. Be aware of this when using this feature.
X
XRemember... displays the Remember Properties dialog that lets
Xyou select things to remember about this instance of an application. The
Xattributes selected to be rememberd in the state they are when you hit Apply or
XOk in this dialog. You will have to bring it up again if you wish to remember
Xa new state of the window.
X
XMore on the next page.
X
XIn the Window Groups submenu there are various options for
Xconfiguring window
Xgroups and how this window relates to any groups you may have. Note that you
Xcannot group Pagers windows or Iconboxes together with
Xeach other or any other windows.
X
XYou can quickly modify the size of a window to one of several aspects of
Xmaxmimum sizes using the Window Size submenu.
X
XSet Stacking lets you change the stacking layer of that window.
X
XYou can change the border using the Set Border Style menu if
Xyou wish to use a different window border. If you change themes after you have
Xchanged the border, and the new theme doesn't provide a border of the same
Xname, the window will fall back to using the DEFAULT border until you
Xchange it again.
X
X=head1 Setting up E to work with KDE and GNOME
X
XEnlightenment, though it strives to be its own desktop environment, also
Xsupports KDE and GNOME desktop environments wherever possible.  Enlightnement
Xcomes set up to support GNOME out of the box, in fact. To enable
Xthe KDE hints, however,
Xyou must launch Enlightenment and then go into the "KDE Support Settings"
Xsection of your Settings menu.  From here you can enable or disable
XKDE support in your copy of Enlightenment.   This setting will automatically
Xsave for the next time you launch Enlightenment.  You should be able to launch
Xany of KDE's or GNOME's applications and have them supported fairly well,
Xincluding (but not limited to) the panel or kpanel, and gmc and kfm.
X
X=head1 Window Placement and Autoraise
X
XThese two Settings dialogs allow you to configure various options
Xfor the placement of windows.  The two Dialog window options are for windows
Xlike the ALT+O open URL window in Netscape.  Manual Placement will force you to
Xuse the mouse to position every new window that attempts to map itself.
X
XThe Autoraise settings Dialog will allow you to set a timer event that causes a
Xwindow to automatically raise itself to the foreground after a set time.  You
Xcan enable it here, as well as change the timer.  This is only useful in the
Xsloppy and pointer focus modes.
X
X=head1 Enligthenment and IPC
X
XEnlightenment has a fairly interesting IPC system that allows external
Xapplications (such as Eterm) to talk to Enlightenment and both ask for
Xinformation and change information.  There is a program that was installed with
XEnlightenment called "eesh" that is a simple shell interface to the IPC in
XEnlightenment.  It's even got its own documentation.  You can go into
Xeesh and type "help" and it should spit back a list of commands that it
Xunderstands.
X
XNote: there are many commands that will show up in E's IPC that don't
Xnecessarily work yet, or aren't fully implemented.  You CAN potentially do some
Xreally bizarre things to your system by using eesh, but for the most part it's
Xjust another interesting interface to E.  In your distribution package you
Xshould have received some sample scripts written in Perl that interface to E
Xthrough eesh showing how you can externally script E to do more things outside
XE's base functionality.  Expect the IPC to flesh out even more in future
Xrevisions.
X
XTo exit eesh, hit CTRL + D (EOF)
X
X=head1 Editing Enlightenment's Menus
X
XThe first time you run Enlightenment as a user after you've installed it, it
Xshould create a directory under your home directory called .enlightenment.  In
Xthis directory, there will be a file called "file.menu" - this file controls
Xthe contents of your left-mouse button Menu .  The very first line
Xof this file contains the title for the menu, and the remainder of the file
Xlooks something like this:
X
X    "Eterm" NULL exec "Eterm"
X
XWhere each column represents:
X
X    Entry title , graphic for menu (or NULL) , exec "commandline"
X
XYou may have several files in here, including a KDE menu and a Gnome menu if
XEnlightenment has detected their presence during installation.  If
Xdetected, your primary apps will be located in another file called
Xuser_apps.menu.  Each of these files is for you to edit as desired.
X
X=head1 Editing Your Keybindings
X
XTo set your own keybindings, all you have to do is find the keybindings.cfg
Xfile that was installed with Enlightenment, and make a copy in your
X~/.enlightenment directory.  This file is fairly long, but shouldn't be too
Xdifficult to edit.  Be careful!  The keybindings in this file will override ALL
Xthe default keybindings, as long as this file exists, so edit this file with
Xextreme caution (unless you know what you're doing).
X
XTo reset your keybindings back to the default, simply remove this file from
Xyour ~/.enlightenment directory.  The next time you restart Enlightenment
Xit should reload the default keybindings into memory.
X
X=head1 Enlightenment and Themes
X
XOne of the strong points of Enlightenment, of course, is that you can change
Xaround the complete look and feel of your desktop whenever you want to.
XIncluded with the 0.16.0 release are a few themes, to show off a little bit of
Xthis configurability.  You can select them by using the middle mouse button
Xmenu , going to the "Themes" selector, and then choosing a new
Xtheme.  Of course, there are plenty more themes for Enlightenment than come
Xwith it by default.  You can find more by going to:
X
Xhttp://e.themes.org
X
Xand searching around until you find something you like.
X
XTo install a new theme
Xis simple: all you need to do is take the bleh.etheme file and drop it into
Xyour
X~/.enlightenment/themes
Xdirectory.  Once you've restarted Enlightenment,
Xit will automatically show up in your Themes menu, and you can
Xchoose it just like any other theme.
X
X=head1 Enlightenment's Eyecandy Features
X
XOf course, Enlightenment wouldn't be complete without just a few bits of
Xeyecandy to play with.  Access them from the "Desktop" portion of your middle
Xmouse button menu.
XThere are two toys that you can choose from:
X
XThe ripples effect - this causes little ripplets of water to reflect on the
Xbottom of your screen.
X
XThe waves effect - similar to ripples, but this one waves up and down as
Xopposed to side-to-side
X
XEach of these can be turned back off simply by using the same menu that you
Xenabled it through.
X
X=head1 Included Maintenance Scripts
X
XEnlightenment comes with several scripts that are executable out of the middle
Xmouse button menu - these scripts can perform all sorts of
Xmaintenance on the files that Enlightenment creates automatically for you.
XWhen you select "Maintenance" you should get a menu that looks something like
Xthe one above-right.  You can also rebuild the KDE and GNOME menus
XEnlightenment uses from here
X
XAs a warning, when you purge configuration information, the next time you
Xrestart Enlightenment it will take longer to load.  You can monitor
XEnlightenment's usage using the query tools provided.  If you change themes a
Xlot you will probably want to purge the config file cache after you've settled
Xon a theme.  This will help keep your disk usage by Enlightenment down.

X=head1 Frequently Asked Questions: Page 1
X
XQ: I can't find my Iconbox or change its settings.
X
XA: There are two possibilities here.
X
X1. You don't have an Iconbox on your desktop right now. Just middle-click and
Xselect Desktop/Create new iconbox
X
X2. Your Iconbox is transparent and borderless.  Iconify a window and see if
Xyour icon appears.  If so, rightclick on it to reconfigure your Iconbox.
X
XQ:  I Can't Seem To Find My Left Mouse Menu
X
XA:  Your menu files may be destroyed.  Try rerunning the program that initially
Xgenerated them.  First you'll want to remove the ~/.enlightenment/*.menu files.
XRebuild them using the Maintenance menu.
X
X=head1 Frequently Asked Questions: Page 2
X
XQ:  All My Settings Are Mangled And I Can't Fix It
X
XA:  Well, if things get really messed up, you can always remove all of
XEnlightenment's automatically saved files.  go into ~/.enlightenment, and
Xremove the ...e_session* files, and then blow away the cached directory.  If
Xyour theme is broken, remove the user_theme.cfg file, also.  The
Xnext time you start Enlightenment it should reset everything to the default.
X
XQ: I Upgraded My Theme, But The New One Isn't Being Used
X
XA: When you upgrade a theme that does not come with Enlightenment, when you go
Xinto your ~/.enlightenment/themes directory, be sure to delete the unpacked
Xdirectory version of your theme that should be sitting next to the theme, if it
Xis there.  Otherwise when Enlightenment attempts to start the new version it
Xwill use the old files, which causes this problem.
X
X=head1 Frequently Asked Questions: Page 3
X
XQ:  I set my window to borderless and can't set it back or move it.
X
XA:  ALT + Right mouse button when pressed anywhere in the window will give you
Xthe window operations menu. ALT + Left mouse button will move the
Xwindow and ALT + Middle mouse button will resize the window.
X
XQ: How can I move or resize the iconbox.
X
XA: As described above, ALT + Right mouse button will give you the
Xwindow operations menu, ALT + Middle mouse button will resize the
Xiconbox and ALT+left mouse button will move it.  See the Iconbox
Xdocumentation for more help
X
XQ: How can I disable that annoying desktop tooltip?
X
XA: There is a special config option for it under the tooltip
Xsettings menu.
X
X=head1 Frequently Asked Questions: Page 4
X
XQ:  These Docs Didn't Help, Where Can I Get More Help?
X
XA: Well, we obviously can't answer all of your questions just by predicting
Xthem, so I would try the website as well as looking at the
Xmailing lists , especially the mail archives.  Chances are that someone
Xelse has probably had the same problem that you have.  And if all that still
Xfails, you might try someone on the irc channel

Xyou. When you have finished reading each page please press the NEXT button on
Xthe top of this window to go to the next page, or use the Back button until you have reached the Docs Index
X.PP
XIf you are reading this right now you have managed to get Enlightenment itself
Xinstalled correctly and are either running Enlightenment for the first time or
Xhave just upgraded to a new version. Congratulations. Now it's time to take
Xyou on a quick tour of the desktop you will have before you.
X.PP
XPlease remember that if you use a theme other than the default
X(Brushed Metal) that it may look slightly or completely different to the
Xcontents of this User Documenation. Some behavior may also vary.
X.PP

X.PP
XA big thanks to several companies that helped support Enlightenment.
X.PP
XRed Hat Software (www.redhat.com) for allowing developers resources and time
Xto work on Enlightenment.
X.PP
XVA Linux Systems (www.valinux.com) for providing hardware, bandwidth, Coke, and
Xthe patience to hire a couple of loony bin candidates to work on something we
X(and hopefully you) think is interesting.
X.PP
XXi Graphics (www.xig.com) for providing X servers to test out code on.
X.PP
XNot only should these people be thanked, but the whole E community \- those on
Xthe E mailing list, on #E on IRC on EFnet and all E users who have provided
Xfeedback and debugging information, bug-fixes, patches and support. A big
Xthanks goes out to all of you who make a project like this possible.
X.PP
XIn addition we'd like to thank several other projects \- such
Xas XFree86, Imlib, Esound, Freetype and many others, The people working on
Xthese equally important projects should not be forgotten.
X.PP

X.PP
XNow that you have started Enlightenment, if you are using it for your desktop
Xshell, your screen should look something like the image here on the left.
X.PP
XAcross the whole top of the screen you will see a bar with arrows pointing
Xup and down on the left and right ends. This is your desktop
XDragbar .
X.PP
XOn the bottom-left you'll see 3 boxes. The top box with the scrollbar attached
Xwill be your Iconbox.
X.PP
XThe other 2 boxes below it are Pagers for desktops 0 and 1. Everything
Xelse is your desktop background.
X.SH "Using Menus"
XWhen you click with your left mouse button on the desktop background you will
Xsee an \*(L"User Menus\*(R" menu appear (example displayed on the right here).
XApplications you may have installed will appear in this menu. To launch one
Xof them simply select it from the menu.
X.PP
XNote: Menus in Enlightenment work like most menu systems. Either hold
Xdown the mouse button and navigate with the button down, releasing on the
Xselection you want, or release elsewhere to not select anything. You can also
Xquickly click and release, then navigate: move the mouse, and click
Xagain on the item you wish to select, or elsewhere if you do not wish to
Xselect an entry.
X.PP
XTo \*(L"stick\*(R" a menu up and leave it up so you can select items from
Xit multiple times, click and hold down the mouse and release on the title of
Xthe menu (if it has one) and it will remain up. You can move it and
Xmanipulate it like a normal window. Close the window to unstick the menu.
X.PP
XClicking the middle button on the desktop background will display
XEnlightenment's main menu. You can access the other menus plus more options
Xfrom this menu (including those to log out, restart and display Help
Xinformation). A sample of this menu is shown to our left.
X.PP
XWhen you click the right mouse button
Xa menu with the title \*(L"Settings\*(R" will appear. This is
XEnlightenment's settings menu. From it you can select various
Xconfiguration dialogs that will assist you in customizing your desktop to
Xbetter suit your needs.
X.SH "Mouse Bindings"
XOf course, when you click on the desktop background of
Xyour screen, normally you will bring up a menu.  And of course, when you
Xclick on the border of a window, you will do various things.  But these
Xare not the only things you can do with your mouse.
X.PP
XIn Enlightenment, there are several other actions that the mouse can do by
Xdefault.  For example, by holding down the ALT key when you click the left
Xmouse button anywhere in a window, you will find that you can move the window
Xaround the screen, just as if you had used the titlebar.  You can also ALT
Xmiddle-click in a window to resize it, or use ALT and right-click to bring up
Xthe Window Operations Menu.
X.PP
XYou will find that holding down the ALT key while clicking the middle
Xmouse button on the background of your desktop will bring up a
Xmenu with the titles of all currently active
Xapplication windows. Selecting one of these will take you to that application.
XBy using the CTRL key instead of ALT you will get a menu displaying all
Xcurrent desktops as sub-menus, with applications on each desktop in the
Xdesktop sub-menu.
X.SH "Mouse Configuration"
XEnlightenment makes extensive use of the mouse.
XHowever, you may be missing some features because of the way
Xthat your mouse is configured on your X server.
X.PP
XIf your mouse does not have a middle button you should enable
X\*(L"Emulate 3 Buttons\*(R" in your X server. This option allows you to
Xemulate a three-button mouse by pressing both left and
Xright mouse buttons at once.
XIf this does not work, three-button emulation  may not be enabled. See
Xyour X server documentation to configure this emulation.
X.PP
XThis may vary from system to system. The OS and X server may also
Xvary the method in which you do this, if it is possible. Not having
Xa middle mouse button in
XEnlightenment, or for that matter X, is not a good thing as it is almost
Xassumed to be there, and is used by many applications, including E.
X.PP
XIf you have a Wheel-Mouse and X is configured to use it, Enlightenment
Xsupports it by default.
X.PP
XRolling your wheel up on the desktop background will take you back a
Xdesktop . Rolling your wheel downward you will advance
Xforward a desktop.
X.PP
XIf this doesn't work, then it may be you haven't configured your X server to
Xunderstand a mouse with a wheel. If you use XFree86 you may need to edit your
XXF86Config to have a \*(L"Pointer\*(R" Section like:
X.PP
X.Vb 6
X\&    Section "Pointer"
X\&    Protocol    "MousemanPlusPS/2"
X\&    Device      "/dev/mouse"
X\&    ZAxisMapping 4 5
X\&    Buttons      5
X\&    EndSection
X.Ve
XYou may need to modify this for your mouse.
X.SH "Using the Window Border"
XWhen you start an application, unless it has special properties, it will come
Xup on your screen with a border surrounding it that contains a titlebar and
Xseveral control buttons.
XThis border is the primary interface to controlling an application window.
XThe Default setup (shown on the next page) gives adequate control but still
Xretains simplicity.
X.PP
XIf you click left mouse button on the titlebar and keep the mouse button down
Xthe window will follow your mouse wherever it moves. Respectively if you click
Xyour left mouse button and drag on any of the resize handles, the window will
Xbe resized in that direction. Clicking right mouse button on the resize
Xhandles will raise the windows to the top.
X.PP
XClicking right mouse button on the titlebar or any button on the window
Xoperations menu button on the top-left will display a menu that has window
Xmanipulation options in it.
X.PP
XDouble-Clicking (clicking the mouse twice in succession really fast) will
Xmake the Window shade or unshade (depending if it was unshaded or shaded to
Xstart with).
X.PP
XClicking left mouse button on the iconify button will iconify the window
Xand send it off to the Iconbox . Hitting the Maximize button will
Xmaximize the
Xsize of the application fill your screen. Hitting it again will Unmaximize,
Xbringing the window back to its normal size.
X.PP
XClicking with the left mouse button on the close button will close the window.
XIf the application that owns that window does not respond to a nice request to
Xexit, then press the right mouse button on the close button to forcibly
Xterminate that window. This should not be used unless the application is
Xvisibly \*(L"hung\*(R".
X.PP
XIn addition to these methods, there are additional ways to manipulation
Xwindows.
X.PP
XIf you hold down the ALT key and hold down left mouse button anywhere in the
Xwindow (on the border OR in the application part) while dragging, you will
Xmove this window around. Doing the same but with the middle mouse button will
Xresize the window in that direction. Clicking the right mouse button anywhere
Xin the window while holding down the ALT key will bring up the window
Xoperations menu.
X.SH "Changing Window Borders"
XFrom time to time you may find that you don't like a particular border that a
Xwindow uses, for some reason or another.  You can easily change the border
Xstyle of a window in Enlightenment using the
X.PP
XWindow Operations
Xmenu, however.  Select the \*(L"Set Border Style\*(R" menu, and a list will be
Xpresented to you of available borders in this theme.  The most common use
Xfor this is to make an application shed its border, using the
XBORDERLESS border type.
X.PP
XYou can always click with ALT + Right mouse button anywhere in the window to
Xbring up the window operations menu again.
X.PP
XIf you want to remember the border style for the next time you run this
Xapplication, you can always use the Remember dialog to remember
Xthe current window border.
X.SH "Default Keybindings"
XBelow are the keybindings for E as it comes \*(L"from the factory\*(R"
X.PP
XCTRL+ALT+Home \- Re-shuffle windows on screen to be Clean
X.PP
XCTRL+ALT+Del \- Exit Enlightenment and Log Out
X.PP
XCTRL+ALT+End \- Restart Enlightenment
X.PP
XCTRL+ALT+Up-Arrow \- Raise window to top

X.PP
XSHIFT+ALT+Left-Arrow \- Move to the virtual desktop on the left if there is one
X.PP
XSHIFT+ALT+Right-Arrow \- Move to the virtual desktop on the right if there is
Xone
X.PP
XSHIFT+ALT+Up-Arrow \- Move to the virtual desktop above if there is one
X.PP
XSHIFT+ALT+Down-Arrow \- Move to the virtual desktop below if there is one
X.PP
XNote: Zooming in and out of windows will only work if you have an XFree86
Xserver or one that implements the Xf86VidMode extension. You also need
Xto define lots of screen modes for your display, so ensure your \*(L"Display\*(R"
Xsubsection of your XF86Config looks like:
X.PP
X.Vb 4
X\&    SubSection "Display"
X\&        Depth 16
X\&        Modes "1600x1200" "1280x1024" "1152x864" "1024x768" "800x600" "640x480" "512x384" "400x300" "320x240"
X\&    EndSubSection
X.Ve
XHave a \*(L"Display\*(R" subsection per depth (this example is for 16 bit) and all
Xthe resolutions defined as above.
X.SH "Multiple & Virtual Desktops"
XEnlightenment supports both Multiple and Virtual desktops. There are
Xdistinct difference between the two, and Enlightenment treats them differently.
X.PP
XWhen you start Enlightenment you will by default have two desktops. In
XEnlightenment desktops are geometrically unrelated work areas. They are
Xvisually stacked on top of each other and can even be dragged down to expose
Xdesktops underneath.
X.PP
XThe best way to imagine this is that each desktop is a sheet of paper with the
Xfirst desktop (desktop 0) being glued in-place. You can re-shuffle the stack
Xof papers and slide one down to reveal a piece of paper underneath \- the only
Xpaper you can't slide is the first one. Each desktop (or sheet) contains your
Xapplication windows.
X.PP
XWindows normally live on one desktop, but can be made
Xto exist on all desktops \- whenever you change to a new desktop the window
Xwill follow you and be on that desktop too. This is known as being sticky.
Xif a window is sticky it will \*(L"stick to the glass of your screen\*(R" and stay
Xthere until it is not sticky anymore or the window is closed.
X.PP
XVirtual desktops (also known as desktop areas) is a measure of how big your
Xdesktops are. A desktop can be a multiple of your screen size in size (2x1,
X2x2, 3x3, 4x2 etc.). That means each desktop has an AxB screen size of area
Xallocated to it and you can be looking at any screen-sized part of it at any
Xtime. It's just like getting more sheets of paper and taping them to the sides
Xof your current sheet of paper. An easy way of changing your view is by just
Xsliding your mouse in the direction of a currently unviewable part of your
Xdesktop. As long as you have Edge Flip enabled Enlightenment will
Xautomatically scroll over to that part of the desktop.
X.PP
XTo change the number of virtual desktops that you have, use the \*(L"Multiple
XDesktop Settings\*(R" dialog from the right mouse settings menu .  You
Xshould see a menu that looks something like the menu to the right.  You can use
Xthe slider bar to quickly select the appropriate number of virtual desktops you
Xwould like to use.
X.PP
XTo change the number of virtual areas, use the \*(L"Virtual Desktop Settings\*(R"
Xmenu.  This will bring up a menu that looks something like the one on the left.
XUse the slider bars to extend the size of the virtual areas to the size that
Xyou prefer. You can also use this dialog to enable/disable edge
Xresistance (when your mouse hits the edge of an area) moving between
Xvirtual areas.
X.PP
XEnlightenment also allows you to set a different desktop backdrop per desktop
Xto help you customize your environment and differentiate which desktop is
Xwhich.
X.PP
XAn easy way of having Enlightenment automatically pick up any pictures you have
Xis to make a directory in your ~/.enlightenment directory called
Xbackgrounds and then fill that with your favorite backdrops. Enlightenment
Xwill automatically discover this and index them for you allowing you to
Xselect them and change their settings. More on this topic is explained in the
XDesktop Backgrounds section.
X.SH "Changing Desktops"
XThere are several ways that you can change your current desktop \- let's go over
Xa few of them here.
X.PP
XYou can use the Keybindings alt-F1 through alt-F12 for the first 12
Xdesktops.
XYou can use the Keybindings Ctrl-Alt-Left and Ctrl-Alt-Right to
Xnavigate to the next/previous desktop.
XYou can use the Keybindings shift-alt-directional arrow to change
Xvirtual areas in a given direction.
XYou can use the Pager to quickly navigate to the desktop/area you want
Xby clicking on the desired area.
XYou can use the Dragbar to quickly navigate to a particular
Xapplication or a particular desktop by using the middle and right mouse
Xbuttons.
XYou can also use external applications such as the GNOME panel's pager or the
XKDE panel's pager to navigate desktops and/or applications.  You will need to
Xenable Desktop Support for these to work.
X.SH "Moving Applications Between Desktops"
XThere are several ways that you can move applications from one desktop to
Xanother.  We'll go over a few of them now.
X.PP
XThe first way you can move apps between desktops is using the Pager.
X.PP
XYou can also move applications between desktops using the
XDragbar.
X.PP
XYou can also move applications between desktops using the
XKDE or GNOME desktop pagers.
X.PP
XYou can also move a window, then bring the window with you as you
Xchange desktops using keybinding.
X.SH "The Dragbar"
XIf you look along the top of your screen, you will notice a long thin bar that
Xlooks something like the bar pictured below.  This is called your Dragbar.  It
Xgets its name from its primary purpose, which is dragging desktops around.
X.PP
XIf
Xyou are on any desktop except desktop 0, you can pick up and move that desktop
Xin another direction.  Desktops documentation has more information
Xon how to change desktops.  Once you have dragged a desktop down, you can
Xproceed to move windows between desktops this way, instead of using the
Xpager.
X.PP
XYou can also use the Dragbar to retrieve windowlists.  Use the middle mouse
Xbutton to retrieve a windowlist, and the right mouse button for a
Xwindowlist sorted by desktops.
X.SH "The Pager"
XPagers may not be a new idea in desktop environments, but the Pager in
XEnlightenment (as seen on the right) is a highly advanced and highly
Xconfigurable tool for desktop and window control, as well as a navigation tool.
X.PP
XThe pager lets you see your desktop screen area in miniature. It lets you click
Xon a certain desktop to \*(L"visit\*(R" it, click and drag windows around in the pager
Xitself to move them about the screen quickly, or between desktops. In this example, we have two virtual areas.  You can see the current area (the
Xone with the windows in it) is also highlighted.
X.PP
XDragging a window from
Xone area of a pager to another will move it there, or to another desktop.
XDragging it out onto the actual desktop will drop that window right there.
XYou can also drag a window into the Iconbox to iconify the window.
X.PP
XPressing right-mouse button over a blank portion of the pager gets you the
Xpager menu, allowing you to change settings.  This will allow you to
Xset a couple of quick options, as shown on the left.  For more available
Xoptions, you can select the \*(L"Pager Settings\*(R" item, and another dialog will pop
Xup, that looks like the one below.
X.PP
XThis dialog box will allow you to set all sorts of additional parameters, many
Xof which can increase the performance of Enlightenment on your system.
XDisabling high quality snapshots and/or snapshots in general as well as
Xcontinuous updates can seriously improve performance \- these features are
Xintended for high end machines.
X.PP
XYou can resize the pager to make it the size you'd like.  Hold down
XALT and use the middle-mouse button to resize the pager in any direction. Using
Xleft-mouse button while holding ALT and dragging will move the window. Holding
Xdown ALT while pressing right-mouse button, just like any normal window will
Xget you a window operations menu.
X.PP
XIn the default theme clicking the tab on the right side of the pager with the
Xarrow pointing right will shade and unshade the pager window horizontally,
Xallowing you to hide and unhide the window easily.
X.PP
XThe striped area above this tab on the pager's border is a handle that will
Xallow you to move the pager about, just like the titlebar of any window.
X.SH "The Iconbox"
XThe iconbox is the place the icons for all your iconified windows go.  It is
Xone method of recovering minimized applications.  Whenever
Xyou iconify or minimize a window it will go into an iconbox and have an icon
Xdisplayed for it there. Clicking on the icon again will de-iconify it.
X.PP
XYou can have as many icon boxes on your desktop as you want to.  You can create
Xmore by using the Middle Click Menu \- select Desktop->Create New Iconbox
Xand a new Iconbox will pop up on your desktop.  Each of these Iconboxes can
Xhave individual configurations, as detailed on the next page.
X.PP
XYou can move the Iconbox around the screen using Alt-Leftclick
Xon the window, and then moving it to the desired location on the screen.  You
Xcan resize the Iconbox by alt-middleclicking on the window and
Xthen adjusting the size  as described in the Mouse Bindings
Xsection.
X.PP
XClicking the right-mouse button anywhere in the Iconbox will bring up a menu
Xto configure that iconbox.  This menu will look a little something like the one
Xhere to the right.  This menu allows you to also close the Iconbox or open up
Xan additional Iconbox.
X.PP
XTo change the settings of an individual Iconbox, we'll use the right mouse
Xbutton menu and select \*(L"This
XIconbox Settings\*(R" \- this should get us a dialog that looks something like the
Xone  to our left.  You can change the orientation, icon size, scrollbar
Xoptions, display policy, base image, and many more options of the Iconbox
Xfrom this dialog.  You may choose to change the anchor of
Xalignment for resizes \- play with it until it resizes appropriately for your
XIconbox location.
X.PP
XIf you want to customize the images used for the icons in your iconbox, there
Xis already an example configuration supplied. To make your own configuration
Xcopy the icondefs.cfg file installed in your Enlightenment system config
Xdirectory (/usr/local/enlightenment/config/icondefs.cfg or
X/usr/share/enlightenment/config/icondefs.cfg) to your ~/.enlightenment
Xdirectory and then edit it. On each line you will find 4 fields. The first
Xfield is the image file to be used. The image is searched for in the usual
Xsearch path if it is not an absolute path to the image file. The search path
Xis in order: ~/.enlightenment, THEME_DIR/, ENLIGHTENMENT_ROOT/config.
X.PP
XThe second field on the line is a shell-glob like match for the title of
Xa window.
XIf this field is irrelevant, NULL is used instead. NB: the only valid wildcard
Xin the glob pattern is \*(L"*\*(R". The third field is the NAME property of the window
Xand the fourth is the CLASS. The order of search priority is last to first,
Xso the last entry in the file that matches a window's title, name and class
Xglobs will use the icon image defined on the first line.
X.PP
XIf you want all windows to have an icon then use:
X.PP
X\*(L"pix/pimage.png\*(R" NULL NULL NULL
X.PP
XThis is the most general match for an icon and will match ALL windows. If you
Xuse this make sure it's at the start of the file so it will only match if no
Xother matches are found.
X.PP
XThere are several examples of using the globbing and matching in the system
Xicondefs.cfg file. Use that as a reference for your own additions.
X.SH "Recovering Minimized Applications"
XThere are several ways to recover an application once you have minimized it.
XThe most obvious way is to use the
XIconbox .  Of course, you might
Xhave had some applications in your Iconbox when you accidentally closed it.  Or
Xmaybe you minimized some applications and forgot you didn't have an Iconbox.
XOr maybe you don't like the Iconbox and usually use KDE or GNOME's panel to
Xrecover them and forgot to launch them.  Never fear.  You can always
Xmiddle click on the Dragbar
Xand get a menu that will allow you
Xto recover them.  You can also Alt or Ctrl-Middleclick on the desktop to get
Xthe same menus (in case you don't have a Dragbar anymore).
X.PP
XRemember, at any time you can always create a new Iconbox to catch
Xyour applications as they minimize, if you want to re-enable it.  Unfortunately
Xyou'll have to reconfigure it since each Iconbox can have its own
Xsettings.
X.SH "Remembering Application Properties"
XIn the window operations menu of every window you will see an
Xentry labeled
X\*(L"Remember...\*(R". If you select this it will bring up the \*(L"Remember\*(R" dialog for
Xthat window (Note: only one of these dialogs can be active at any one time), as
Xshown to our right.
X.PP
XThis dialog lets you selectively snapshot certain attributes of that window at
Xthat time and have Enlightenment remember them. You may choose to only remember
Xsome of the attributes, and possibly not have the application started
Xautomatically for you. Choose what you want Enlightenment to remember about that
Xwindow and hit \*(L"Apply\*(R" or \*(L"OK\*(R" if you don't need the dialog anymore, and
XEnlightenment will, the next time that instance of the application is run,
Xapply the current location, size, border style or any other attribute to
Xthat window. Enlightenment can also launch the application for you upon startup
Xif you so wish.
X.SH "Settings"
XWhen you click the right mouse button on the desktop background you will pop
Xup the Settings menu. From here you can select an aspect of Enlightenment to
Xconfigure to your liking. There are too many settings to actually document
Xfully right now, but the likelihood is if you want a particular behavior from
XEnlightenment, it is achievable by merely playing with these options.
X.PP
XCombinations of options are often required to get the effect you want, so some
Xexperimentation may be required. Do not be frightened. Nothing you can do
Xcan't be undone by simply changing the options back to how they were and
Xclicking on Apply again.
X.SH "Window Groups"
XSometimes you have a number of windows on your desktop that logically go
Xtogether. Enlightenment allows you to group windows
Xtogether, so that whenever you change a property of one window in a group,
Xthe change is reflected on the other group members. If you have a group whose
Xmembers span multiple desktops , changing a group's property
Xaffects only windows of that group that are on the current desktop.
X.PP
XThe properties that you can change for an entire group include setting the window
Xborder, iconifying, killing, moving, raising/lowering, sticking and shading of
Xa window.
X.PP
XTo define what properties are applied to a group by default, you go to the
Xsettings menu and pick the \*(L"Group Settings\*(R" option, which will give
Xyou a dialog window in which you can configure the settings, as shown here on
Xthe right.
X.PP
XThere are two different methods for manipulating window groups. First, there's a
Xcomprehensive submenu available in each window's operations menu
Xcalled \*(L"Window Groups\*(R".  This menu is shown here on the right.  You also are
Xable to configure the group individually apart from the default group settings
X(as shown on the previous page).
X.PP
XThe second way is the window titlebar, which has the most important options
Xdirectly available for convenience. Shift-click to start a group,
XCtrl-clicking to add a window to the youngest group (also referred to as the
X\*(L"current\*(R" group) and Shift-Ctrl-Click to destroying a group. You can also click
Xthe middle mouse button for visualizing the \fIgroup\fR\|(s) of a window. Click again
Xto returning to the previous border.
X.PP
XWindows can be in multiple groups at the same time, so for many
Xoptions you have to indicate which group you are referring to.
XSelecting the appropriate checkboxes (showing the group members\*(R' titles)
Xat the top of the dialog windows.
X.SH "Selecting and Adding backgrounds"
XOften you will want to change the background of a particular desktop.  There
Xare several ways you can do this.  But of course, to change your desktop,
Xyou'll need to give Enlightenment some graphics to play with.  A desktop
Xtheme may add a background or two to your available selections, but
Xmost users want to have even backgrounds to choose from.  To add backgrounds to your
Xselection, make a backgrounds directory under your home directory.  To
Xdo this using most shells you can type
X.PP
Xmkdir ~/.enlightenment/backgrounds
X.PP
XOnce you've done this, you should restart Enlightenment \- this can be done
Xquickly and easily by simply hitting the Ctrl-Alt-End key combination.  When
XEnlightenment starts up, it will rescan these directories, and add new files
Xinto the background selector.
X.PP
XOnce you have added your backgrounds and restarted Enlightenment, you should be
Xable to go to the root menu desktop selector.  To get to this menu, middle
Xclick on the desktop, select \*(L"Desktop\*(R",
Xand go to Backgrounds.  You should get something that looks similar to the
Ximage  on the right.  From here you will be able to navigate the backgrounds
Xmenus.
X.PP
X(Click next for more information)
X.PP
XOnce you have opened up the backgrounds menu, you should see something similar
Xto the image below.  From here, you can put your mouse over any of the images
Xthere, and it will change the desktop background of the current desktop to the
Ximage that you have selected.
X.PP
XEnlightenment will attempt to choose the best
Xsettings for a particular background, but if it gets it wrong you can always
Xchange the settings by hand.  By bringing up the settings menu with the right
Xmouse button and selecting the \*(L"Desktop Background Settings\*(R" item, you can
Xbring up a dialog that looks something like the one on the next page . ..
X.PP
XYou can use this dialog to change your background, too , as well as fine-tune
Xall the various settings for each individual background available.
X.SH "Tooltips"
XFrom time to time, as you use Enlightenment, if you don't remember what does
Xwhat, if you keep the mouse still for a little bit a tooltip will pop up.  The
Xeasiest example of this is when you hold the mouse over a Window Border.
X.PP
XYou can disable the tooltips or change the delay before they pop up by
Xselecting the \*(L"Tooltip Settings\*(R" dialog from the settings menu, as
Xshown here on the left.
X.SH "Audio"
XOf course, Enlightenment comes preconfigured to play lots of little blips and
Xbeeps when you do various things on your desktop.  In order to use sound in
XEnlightenment, you must have both ESounD and audiofile installed.  You can find
Xmore information about these libraries from http://www.gnome.org.
X.PP
XYou can enable and/or disable sound at runtime simply by selecting from the
XSettings menu the \*(L"Audio Settings\*(R" option, which brings up a dialog,
Xshown here at right.
X.SH "Special Effects"
XEnlightenment has many features that are configured via the \*(L"Special FX\*(R"
Xsettings dialog.  Here you can configure the Dragbar ,
Xvarious sliding speeds (including the speed of a windowshade), as well as
Xtoggle animation of different features.  You can also configure the method used
Xfor sliding windows, similar to
Xresize modes .
X.PP
XThere are several FX features disabled by default
Xin a new installation, including the animated display of menus.  You can also
Xenable saveunders here, which may improve or slow down the performance of
XEnlightenment on your X server, depending on server and configuration.
X.SH "Setting the Focus"
XEnlightenment offers lots of different options for focusing windows.  By
Xdefault, it comes up in sloppy focus mode.  There are two other primary focus
Xmodes supported by Enlightenment \- click to focus and pointer focus.
X.PP
XClick To Focus most people are familiar with.  You click on a window and it
Xreceives the focus from Enlightenment.
X.PP
XPointer Focus gives the focus to whichever window the pointer is sitting over
X.PP
XSloppy Focus is similar to Pointer Focus, except that if you go over the
Xdesktop background you still are focused on the last window
X.PP
XNext we'll tell you how to change these settings.
X.PP
XEnlightenment allows you to change your focus settings at any time.  Simply
Xbring up the Settings menu and then select \*(L"Focus Settings\*(R" to bring
Xup a dialog that looks something like the one on the right.  At the top, we can
Xselect between our three focus modes, as described on the previous page.
X.PP
XWe can also enable some other features, such as one that will allow a simple
Xmouse click to raise any window to the foreground, as well as several
Xother advanced focus settings.
X.PP
XHere we can also enable the focuslist feature.  This feature requires Xkb to be
Xenabled in your X server.  If you don't have Xkb enabled, please consult your X
Xserver documentation to see how to do this.  The focuslist is a
Xwindow list that pops up
Xas you cycle through your focus using the ALT + TAB
XKeybinding.
X.SH "Moving Windows"
XEnlightenment comes with several different available methods for moving a
Xwindow.  You can perform the actual moves using the  Window
X.PP
XBorder, or by using the available
X.PP
XMouse Bindings .  This will cause the window to move until you have
Xreleased the mouse button.
X.PP
XTo change the mode that the moving of the windows uses (opaque being the
Xdefault), open up the Settings menu, and select \*(L"Move & Resize
XSettings\*(R".  You can select from a list that looks similar to the one here
Xabove-right.  Experiment until you find one that suits you best.
X.PP
XFor some serious eyecandy, try out the Translucent move mode.  This will only
Xwork if your X server and Enlightenment are running on the same machine,
Xhowever.
X.SH "Resizing Windows"
XEnlightenment also comes with several available methods for resizing windows.
XYou can perform the actual resize on the window by clicking on any
Xresize-handle of your window border and dragging to the desired size.
XYou can also get the same effect by using the ALT + middle button
Xmouse binding in any part of the window.
X.PP
XTo change the mode that the resizing of the windows uses (opaque being the
Xdefault), open up the Settings menu, and select \*(L"Move & Resize
XSettings\*(R".  You can select from a list that looks similar to the one here
Xabove-right.  Experiment until you find one that suits you best.
X.PP
XThe best eyecandy resize mode is probably technical move mode.  This mode shows
Xyou the height and width of the window, in addition to the distance from the
Xnearest edge.
X.SH "The Window Operations Menu"
XThe Window Operations menu is a commonly used menu that allows you to perform
Xmany different actions onto the current window.
X.PP
XThe Close function closes the window in question.
XAnnihilate destroys the window without
Xregard to the application the window belongs to, which is especially useful if
Xthe application refuses to respond to being closed with Close.
X.PP
XThe Iconify function iconifies the window.
XIf you have an
X.PP
XIconbox
Xit is sent to the nearest one.
X.PP
XThe Raise function raises the window above any windows
Xthat may be obscuring it and Lower
Xlowers it below windows it is obscuring.
X.PP
XMore on the next page.
X.PP
XShade/Unshade toggles the shaded state of the window. Note that borderless
Xwindows are not allowed to be shaded.
X.PP
XStick/Unstick toggles the sticky state of a window. A window that is sticky
Xremains \*(L"stuck to the glass\*(R" and thus is visible on all virtual and
Xmultiple desktops.
X.PP
XFullscreen/Window zooms in and out of the window changing resolutions
Xif possible. This feature will only work if you have your X server configured
Xcorrectly and it supports the XVidtune extension. Your X server may not like
Xhaving resolutions changed \- it is possible that an unstable X server could
Xcrash if you use this. Be aware of this when using this feature.
X.PP
XRemember... displays the Remember Properties dialog that lets
Xyou select things to remember about this instance of an application. The
Xattributes selected to be rememberd in the state they are when you hit Apply or
XOk in this dialog. You will have to bring it up again if you wish to remember
Xa new state of the window.
X.PP
XMore on the next page.
X.PP
XIn the Window Groups submenu there are various options for
Xconfiguring window
Xgroups and how this window relates to any groups you may have. Note that you
Xcannot group Pagers windows or Iconboxes together with
Xeach other or any other windows.
X.PP
XYou can quickly modify the size of a window to one of several aspects of
Xmaxmimum sizes using the Window Size submenu.
X.PP
XSet Stacking lets you change the stacking layer of that window.
X.PP
XYou can change the border using the Set Border Style menu if
Xyou wish to use a different window border. If you change themes after you have
Xchanged the border, and the new theme doesn't provide a border of the same
Xname, the window will fall back to using the DEFAULT border until you
Xchange it again.
X.SH "Setting up E to work with KDE and GNOME"
XEnlightenment, though it strives to be its own desktop environment, also
Xsupports KDE and GNOME desktop environments wherever possible.  Enlightnement
Xcomes set up to support GNOME out of the box, in fact. To enable
Xthe KDE hints, however,
Xyou must launch Enlightenment and then go into the \*(L"KDE Support Settings\*(R"
Xsection of your Settings menu.  From here you can enable or disable
XKDE support in your copy of Enlightenment.   This setting will automatically
Xsave for the next time you launch Enlightenment.  You should be able to launch
Xany of KDE's or GNOME's applications and have them supported fairly well,
Xincluding (but not limited to) the panel or kpanel, and gmc and kfm.
X.SH "Window Placement and Autoraise"
XThese two Settings dialogs allow you to configure various options
Xfor the placement of windows.  The two Dialog window options are for windows
Xlike the ALT+O open URL window in Netscape.  Manual Placement will force you to
Xuse the mouse to position every new window that attempts to map itself.
X.PP
XThe Autoraise settings Dialog will allow you to set a timer event that causes a
Xwindow to automatically raise itself to the foreground after a set time.  You
Xcan enable it here, as well as change the timer.  This is only useful in the
Xsloppy and pointer focus modes.
X.SH "Enligthenment and IPC"
XEnlightenment has a fairly interesting IPC system that allows external
Xapplications (such as Eterm) to talk to Enlightenment and both ask for
Xinformation and change information.  There is a program that was installed with
XEnlightenment called \*(L"eesh\*(R" that is a simple shell interface to the IPC in
XEnlightenment.  It's even got its own documentation.  You can go into
Xeesh and type \*(L"help\*(R" and it should spit back a list of commands that it
Xunderstands.
X.PP
XNote: there are many commands that will show up in E's IPC that don't
Xnecessarily work yet, or aren't fully implemented.  You CAN potentially do some
Xreally bizarre things to your system by using eesh, but for the most part it's
Xjust another interesting interface to E.  In your distribution package you
Xshould have received some sample scripts written in Perl that interface to E
Xthrough eesh showing how you can externally script E to do more things outside
XE's base functionality.  Expect the IPC to flesh out even more in future
Xrevisions.
X.PP
XTo exit eesh, hit CTRL + D (EOF)
X.SH "Editing Enlightenment's Menus"
XThe first time you run Enlightenment as a user after you've installed it, it
Xshould create a directory under your home directory called .enlightenment.  In
Xthis directory, there will be a file called \*(L"file.menu\*(R" \- this file controls
Xthe contents of your left-mouse button Menu .  The very first line
Xof this file contains the title for the menu, and the remainder of the file
Xlooks something like this:
X.PP
X.Vb 1
X\&    "Eterm" NULL exec "Eterm"
X.Ve
XWhere each column represents:
X.PP
X.Vb 1
X\&    Entry title , graphic for menu (or NULL) , exec "commandline"
X.Ve
XYou may have several files in here, including a KDE menu and a Gnome menu if
XEnlightenment has detected their presence during installation.  If
Xdetected, your primary apps will be located in another file called
Xuser_apps.menu.  Each of these files is for you to edit as desired.
X.SH "Editing Your Keybindings"
XTo set your own keybindings, all you have to do is find the keybindings.cfg
Xfile that was installed with Enlightenment, and make a copy in your
X~/.enlightenment directory.  This file is fairly long, but shouldn't be too
Xdifficult to edit.  Be careful!  The keybindings in this file will override ALL
Xthe default keybindings, as long as this file exists, so edit this file with
Xextreme caution (unless you know what you're doing).
X.PP
XTo reset your keybindings back to the default, simply remove this file from
Xyour ~/.enlightenment directory.  The next time you restart Enlightenment
Xit should reload the default keybindings into memory.
X.SH "Enlightenment and Themes"
XOne of the strong points of Enlightenment, of course, is that you can change
Xaround the complete look and feel of your desktop whenever you want to.
XIncluded with the 0.16.0 release are a few themes, to show off a little bit of
Xthis configurability.  You can select them by using the middle mouse button
Xmenu , going to the \*(L"Themes\*(R" selector, and then choosing a new
Xtheme.  Of course, there are plenty more themes for Enlightenment than come
Xwith it by default.  You can find more by going to:
X.PP
Xhttp://e.themes.org
X.PP
Xand searching around until you find something you like.
X.PP
XTo install a new theme
Xis simple: all you need to do is take the bleh.etheme file and drop it into
Xyour
X~/.enlightenment/themes
Xdirectory.  Once you've restarted Enlightenment,
Xit will automatically show up in your Themes menu, and you can
Xchoose it just like any other theme.
X.SH "Enlightenment's Eyecandy Features"
XOf course, Enlightenment wouldn't be complete without just a few bits of
Xeyecandy to play with.  Access them from the \*(L"Desktop\*(R" portion of your middle
Xmouse button menu.
XThere are two toys that you can choose from:
X.PP
XThe ripples effect \- this causes little ripplets of water to reflect on the
Xbottom of your screen.
X.PP
XThe waves effect \- similar to ripples, but this one waves up and down as
Xopposed to side-to-side
X.PP
XEach of these can be turned back off simply by using the same menu that you
Xenabled it through.
X.SH "Included Maintenance Scripts"
XEnlightenment comes with several scripts that are executable out of the middle
Xmouse button menu \- these scripts can perform all sorts of
Xmaintenance on the files that Enlightenment creates automatically for you.
XWhen you select \*(L"Maintenance\*(R" you should get a menu that looks something like
Xthe one above-right.  You can also rebuild the KDE and GNOME menus
XEnlightenment uses from here
X.PP
XAs a warning, when you purge configuration information, the next time you
Xrestart Enlightenment it will take longer to load.  You can monitor
XEnlightenment's usage using the query tools provided.  If you change themes a
Xlot you will probably want to purge the config file cache after you've settled
Xon a theme.  This will help keep your disk usage by Enlightenment down.

XRebuild them using the Maintenance menu.

XQ:  All My Settings Are Mangled And I Can't Fix It
X.PP
XA:  Well, if things get really messed up, you can always remove all of
XEnlightenment's automatically saved files.  go into ~/.enlightenment, and
Xremove the ...e_session* files, and then blow away the cached directory.  If
Xyour theme is broken, remove the user_theme.cfg file, also.  The
Xnext time you start Enlightenment it should reset everything to the default.
X.PP
XQ: I Upgraded My Theme, But The New One Isn't Being Used
X.PP
XA: When you upgrade a theme that does not come with Enlightenment, when you go
Xinto your ~/.enlightenment/themes directory, be sure to delete the unpacked
Xdirectory version of your theme that should be sitting next to the theme, if it
Xis there.  Otherwise when Enlightenment attempts to start the new version it
Xwill use the old files, which causes this problem.

XQ:  I set my window to borderless and can't set it back or move it.
X.PP
XA:  ALT + Right mouse button when pressed anywhere in the window will give you
Xthe window operations menu. ALT + Left mouse button will move the
Xwindow and ALT + Middle mouse button will resize the window.
X.PP
XQ: How can I move or resize the iconbox.
X.PP
XA: As described above, ALT + Right mouse button will give you the
Xwindow operations menu, ALT + Middle mouse button will resize the
Xiconbox and ALT+left mouse button will move it.  See the Iconbox
Xdocumentation for more help
X.PP
XQ: How can I disable that annoying desktop tooltip?
X.PP
XA: There is a special config option for it under the tooltip
Xsettings menu.

XQ:  These Docs Didn't Help, Where Can I Get More Help?
X.PP
XA: Well, we obviously can't answer all of your questions just by predicting
Xthem, so I would try the website as well as looking at the
Xmailing lists , especially the mail archives.  Chances are that someone
Xelse has probably had the same problem that you have.  And if all that still
Xfails, you might try someone on the irc channel
