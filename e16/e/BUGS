----------
Known bugs
----------

- E may lose control over a window if it is iconified and de-iconified
  shortly after.

- Switching desktop changes stacking (sticky windows raised above non-sticky).

- The pager mini-window tooltips are sometimes not unmapped when they should be.

- When right clicking a zoomed pager mini-window to get the menu, the
  mini-window and tooltip are not unmapped.

- Various minor focus issues.
  Exact steps to reproduce are welcome.

- Window placement when low on space could be improved.
  In particular, we should try harder not to cover the dont-cover windows.

- When zooming (fullscreen) decreases screen resolution, the mouse should be
  confined to the zoomed window.
! May be impossible to fix due to limitations in X (vidmode extension, mouse
  grabs).


Fixed in CVS
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- When using click-to-focus and closing focused window, focus isn't
  returned to the previously focused window (introduced in pre8).

- Regenerating menus will replace custom file.menu and user_apps.menu
  (introduced with new e_gen_menu in pre7).

- Applications (vmware, gaim, mozilla, ...) cannot de-iconify their
  windows (introduced in pre5).


Fixed in E 16.6-pre8
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Enabling the "ripples" (and other) effects cause a dialog to be shown at
  startup. This becomes somewhat annoying in the long run.


Fixed in E 16.6-pre7
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Making slightly offscreen windows (x/y < 0) sticky causes them to be
  moved (x/y += screen.w/h). This may (aot.) cause pagers and iconboxes
  to go (almost) offscreen when changing the theme.

- Menu generation script (e_gen_menu etc.) is not up to current standards.


Fixed in E 16.6-pre6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- _NET_WORKAREA hint is not supported (breaking kuickshow, among others).

- If the focus list (Alt-Tab) gets covered, it is not redrawn when exposed.
  The real problem is that the window list is not supposed to get covered.

- The focus list is sometimes not closed when it should be.
  Press Alt, press Ctrl, release Ctrl, press Tab, release Tab, release Alt.

- Window ("remember") settings may not be saved on exit.


Fixed in E 16.6-pre5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- The maintenance menu is missing.

- Rapid iconify/deiconify may cause E to "lose" the window.

- Maximise bug with Xinerama.

- Non-fsstd configuration/install is broken.

- De-iconfy of windows not entirely on-screen is broken.

Fixed in E 16.6-pre4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- The scripts have dropped out of the distribution files.

- Focus problem when switching desktops.

- Pager mini-window is not removed after click without drag.
