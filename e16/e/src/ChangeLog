fixed crashing bug.  non-input windows being selected as the selected window no
longer should crash everything

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mon Mar 15 20:55:34 EST 1999
(Mandrake)

fixing things to say 0.15.3...  blah.  damned bugs :)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(Mandrake)

ARGH.  bug bug bug.  some code got commented out that shouldn't have been
commented out last night in draw.c.  uncommented and committing.
(messes up shaped/borderless window resizes)
increased revision number to 0.15.4.  hope to release some time tomorrow.
maybe I'll tackle some other bugs before then.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wed Mar 17 14:52:24 EST 1999

Fixed a bug in translucent move mode in draw.c

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thu Mar 18 02:38:18 EST 1999
(Mandrake)

Added network.c and update.c - VERY rough skeleton code.  user-optional
automatic code updates and update testing

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sat Mar 20 13:21:14 EST 1999
(Mandrake)

added button_show IPC command

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mon Mar 22 02:52:04 EST 1999
(Mandrake)

a little bit of work on the auto-update stuff.  I still have a long way to go
here, but I thought that I would go ahead and start putting in a little bit of
logic here and there for the upgrade paths.  still no actual http support.
debating on whether or not to use ghttp (since it doesn't require any of gnome
I'm thinking about it)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mon Mar 22 03:53:51 EST 1999
(Mandrake)

Cleaned up epp a little more.  still LOTS of work there.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mon Mar 22 20:46:46 EST 1999

cleaned up auto-upgrade to where it won't compile if you don't have libghttp.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(KainX)

Fixed a bug with reverting focus to desktop zero.  If you went from desktop 0
to desktop 2 to desktop 6, then back to desktop 0, a window on desktop 2 would
remain focused.  Not any more. =)

Also added code to revert to the default colormap when leaving a window or a
desktop.  Most users won't notice this.  But you definitely will see a
difference if you use Netscape with the "-install" option. :-)

Commented out the debugging output for select() since it was confusing the hell
out of lots of users.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well - back from CEBIT... and now to the goodies...

* added pager that does snapshots - and continuous snapshot updating... works 
beautifully with almost no cpu use on a local machine - it'll probably kill 
your network if you run it over a network... :( But it does everything
except allowe you to drag and drop windows around (at the moment) - that will
be added.

* added mode.show_pagers option that is internal for now...

* added flatfile menu loading - sorry - no examples yet - but it works and
automagically updates the menu if the file changes. It makes constructing menus
childs play - I mean REALLY childs play.

* fixed countless minor buglets.

* added area sliding (if desktop sliding is on areas will slide around too)

* fixed manual placement so the mouse up doesnt get passed onto clients under
the pointer then the window is placed

* fixed window list off dragbar so things dont die when you try focus an ewin 
ID that doesnt exist anymore

* this brings E's code (not including fnlib, imlib etc.) up to about 60756
lines of code.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wed Mar 31 10:28:48 CST 1999
(KainX)

When we use the pager to make a window sticky, bring that window to the
current desktop as one would expect to happen.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wed Mar 31 17:30:49 EST 1999
(Raster)

* fixed numlock / scrollock keybinding / action etc. issues....

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thu Apr  1 14:56:19 EST 1999

netowrk updates, etc

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Apr  2 00:56:47 EST 1999
(Mandrake)

Lots of stuff.  ipc commands.  pager command now enables and disables the pager
- made a couple of generic functions EnableAllPagers() and DisableAllPagers()
to do the actual work there.  also added skeleton of the fx command.  will do
that tonight as I watch a movie.  added move_mode and resize_mode commands
(since everyone seems to have wanted that and I don't know how those slipped my
mind) they're not documented well yet, but if you read ipc.c you should be able
to guess how they work (they all work similarly to other ipc commands - I like
the interface I'm brewing up and I'm likely to continue using it)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Apr  2 12:04:19 EST 1999
(Mandrake)

#if 0'd some stuff out for 0.15.5 release

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sun Apr  4 17:10:08 EDT 1999
(Mandrake)

lots of IPC work.  new fx command.  also a big restructuring of the code itself
in the ipc array (much prettier to the eye)
also I commented a few bits of code -- it's now documented somewhat how to add
new IPC commands in there.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sun Apr  4 20:04:20 EDT 1999
(Mandrake)

more IPC work.  now many win_op commands have status checks
win_op <windowid> <operation> ?
as well as support 
win_op <windowid> <operation> <on/off>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sun Apr  4 21:32:43 EDT 1999
(Mandrake)

added more "?" commands to win_op
very useful.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sun Apr  4 23:04:17 EDT 1999
(Mandrake)

CPPFLAGS problems people were having should be solved
put the -D stuff from e/src/Makefile.am into econfig.h

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mon Apr  5 21:30:50 EDT 1999

updated some numbers to 0.16.0 -> time to say goodbye to 0.15

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mon Apr  5 22:59:08 EDT 1999
(Mandrake)

holy cow, commented some code.  Also split out all the initial setup of
fallback classes into SetupFallbackClasses() in init.c -- cleans up main.c
considerably

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tue Apr  6 18:54:54 EDT 1999
(Mandrake)

minor bugfix care of Daniele Paoni for java applications.
also some more comments.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thu Apr  8 02:33:54 EDT 1999
(Raster)

again - minor fixes to manual placement, a few other little things here and 
there scattered about.... but one major addition...

you can drag windows around the pager now... and..... between pagers for 
desktops... soi you can move windows form any area to any desktop and around
any desktop now... and it all works nicely... :)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thu Apr  8 11:39:45 EDT 1999

added general_info IPC command.  just has screen_size in it now, but I
am sure tehre will be more going in later

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Apr  9 17:16:27 EDT 1999
(Mandrake)

fleshed out soundclass ipc

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sat Apr 10 00:26:09 EDT 1999

Sat Apr 10 10:53:00 EDT 1999
(Mandrake)

Somehow network.c got messed up inbetween compile and commit.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

merged pager stuff into uni-pager command.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tue Apr 20 17:48:12 EDT 1999
(Raster)

Again - I've been lazy with the changelog... but I have done a buttload...
lets summarise...

* added slider widget and event handleing
* added drawing area widget and event handleing 
* added sliders to all dialog settings boxes that need them
* added start of a background editor dialog
* added multiple desktop editor
* fixed soem menu bugs
* fixed memory leaks
* fixed "app resizes whilst being moved" bug
* fixed tables instie tables so they work
* optimised backgorudns menu a bit better for file searching
* got rid of redundant sound code that esd now does
* fixed minor bug in WAV loading code
* added elements to brushed metal theme to supply data for new widgets & 
  features
* fixed 1 or 2 little pager bugs
* fixed possible segfault in text shortening code
* fixed internationalisation problem in saving and reading floats
* did lots of other fixes and adds I've forgotten about

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Apr 23 12:38:30 EDT 1999
(Raster)

* added desktop background selector AND editor settings dialog - all gui - all
  works. You can't select files to use as backgrounds yet - need file selector
  dialog for that (probably next on my list) BUT if you have E generate 
  background defs from ~/.enlightenmen/backgrounds (which should be a symlink
  to wherever you store your images, or just fill that directory with images
  and sibdirectories and images - E will auto-index them into the backgrounds
  menu). you can edit all of those and their attributes, and clone versions
  then edit the clones, modify them, remove the images to use a solid color
  instead - etc. all works.. :)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sat May 15 15:04:35 EDT 1999
(Raster)

* added pager background caching - now pager backrounds will be cached and 
  saved to disk for faster "repainting" or initial painting. This should
  work now.

* session saving no longer saves "-theme" optin ofr command line - the
  ~/.enlightenment/user_theme.cfg takes pcare of this.

* "snapshots" now use a snapshot dialog. snapshotting location also snaps
  desktop area as well (since a desktop is one virtually large desktop).
  It can also snap the "command" and be able to start the apps up again on
  startup if you select that option. You can also select if the snapped
  attributes are to apply toall windows of that class and not just the first
  instance. should be a lot nicer.

* some minor pager updating bugs fixed - now if you close a window on another
  desktop area it updates properly. the pager "hilight" zoom window should
  now be pretty hard to make hang around - paranoia added to hide all zoom
  window whenever there is a chance we dont want them.
  
* minor memory leak fixed.

* brushed metal theme now has different pager border style - more of a 
  demonstration now of the power of internal ewins that are beng used for the
  pager border and how you can make them vehave like a slideout so you can
  shade the pager out of the way when you dont want it.

* X11R5 apps should be session managed pproperly now if E is X11R6 session
  managed - they shoudl normally go back on the same desktop etc. - but its
  not guaranteed - still not 100% unambiguous to determine windows of
  unique apps.

* fixed cloning bug where double cloning happens on desktop switch - sticky 
  windows should not flicker as much now. should be faster / more efficient

* fixed numerous other little buglets and made numerous other little speedups
  and improvements.
  
* added new menu scrolling method patch from Christian - very nice - thanks
  fixed one minor bug in it.

* added rotated fonts patch from, Christian - thanks again.

* fixed app re-focus when we go back to the previous desktop in click-to-focus

* fixed potential pixmap leak

* suggest using Imlib from CVS - E triggered a pixmap leak - OOOPS - fixed

* should have fixed "wierd focus behavior" when flipping desktops - basically
  now the code goes throuhg ALL ewins - ALL the border parts and removes motion
  enter leave and other miscellaneous events that may trigger E to respond to
  these and set the focus to that window - so basically we now get E to not
  recieve any such tiggering events whilst flipping desktops.

* fixed some internal stack tracing problems where we forget to wrap some
  returns form some functions.

* added options for turing pager zoom on and off - loads ans saves it and
  has settings check button for it.

* added window title popup option and code (using tooltip as definition
  backend - now have PAGER tooltip type to define this). loads and saves
  this option - also has settings check button for it.

* added PAGER tooltip type (and image & text classes for it) to BrushedMetal 
  theme.
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri May 14 12:40:27 IST 1999
(Merlin)

* Fixed a bug in list.c movetofront that turned lists into loops.

* Updated keyboard warping to operate more sanely; especially in a cramped
  desktop with lots of overlapping windows. At start, it makes a list of
  the warpring; then when you release alt (currently hardwired for only
  alt) it dumps the warpring. Added configuration option 'raise after warp'
  if you use focus with pointer; when you release alt, the chosen window
  is raised. Also, displays the title of the windows it is warping to so
  you know, even if you can't see them. This is only compiled in if you
  define WITH_TARTY_WARP; see E.h; needs XKB X extension.

* Added action MOVE_CONTRAINED which is a normal window move, but the
  window is absolutely constrained to the current view area.

* Changed menu handling so if you click on a menu item, drag off it and
  then release, the menu item is not activated. So you can undo a mistaken
  click.

More modules work.  Now we can load and unload modules.  they don't do much
yet, though.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sat May 29 13:14:42 PDT 1999
(Mandrake)

more modules work.  the unloading should actually work correctly now (wasn't
removing them before).
Also, the ipc "exit" command now runs a logout (pops up a dialog box) unless
you pass a parameter (of any kind) to it.
people should learn to use the IPC help mechanisms.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sat May 29 19:08:59 PDT 1999

some work on reference counting.  Things should start picking up now that
at least one class does reference counting properly in one instance.
(this is a very large problem to solve)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wed Jun  9 12:49:52 PDT 1999

Committing work on iconbox - scrollbar, scrollarrows ec. all work - in theory
i can re-arrange the arrows to be either end, on one of the ends or no arrows
and arrange the scrollbar to be on the botton or top.. some code left to do
vertical iconbox - not much though - just scrollbar arrangement code.

iconify and de-iconfi works all great - only thing to watch.. dont restart
E with iconified windows.. you'll lose their icons right now.. need to fix
that.

next need to ad non snapshotted icon support (several stages - use E defined 
icons only, use E definied icons only if defined, otherwise use snapshotted
icons, use app defined icons only if defined otherwise use snapshots, 
use E defined icons if defined, otherwise use app defined icon if defined,
if not defined use snapshot.. not ot mention the introduction of default
E defined icons for all unknown windows - then the actual icon def list itself
and the config system for that etc... then need to support multiple iconboxes
and dnd form pager to iconbox and back... and between iconboxes... then 
definable iconification into certain iconboxes - and also need to support
transparent backgrouns for iconbox - thus simulating the old icons floating 
about thing... but its all coming...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Jul 16 03:31:40 EST 1999
(Raster)

Iconbox now handles ghe horizontal, the vertical, all scrollbar optiond - even
has a settings dialog box (right muse on iconbox). it can even be transparent.

I also optimised property change event handling - e should be much much much
more eficient at it avoiding lots of unecessary X traffic.

Changed gthe box draw mode to move the inner box 1 pixel in so on borderless
window you can see the border when moving & resizing.

added icon creation policy code.

in the middle of ading icon list code /9that determines what icon image is
to be used for what apps and is user definable)

play with the iconbox - it shouldnt be too bad. :)

KDE hints start.  rev 1 didn't actually work, so we started over

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mon Jul 19 23:03:11 EST 1999
(Raster)

* fixed minor shape propagation bug
* improved dialog code by adding bindable callback keyboard shortcuts
* improved backgroudns dialog... I just got an influx of about 4000 new pix,
  and it did get a bit tedious as i have to filter the backgrounds to only
  keep the good ones... now the backgrounds dialog can becme almost an image
  viewer that lets me filter my background colletcion... not to mention some
  keyboard shorts work now (like left/right arrow, d, delete, space and
  backspace)
* iconbox now starts up when E starts - still doesnt remember settings but
  iconifed windows on start / restart get handled now, and added some 
  imageclasses for the iconbox widget parts - still need more bits put in
  though like a scrollbar knob imageclass and a iconbox frame imageclass
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tue Jul 20 02:34:29 EST 1999
(Raster)

* added iconbox coverwin support and imageclass - if the iclass is there the
cover win is displayed... also updated brushed metal. again.. to include this
stuff.

Mon Jul 26 14:03:39 PDT 1999
(Troy R. Pesola)

Here is a patch file that incorporates the following:

-fixed actions.c to set the desktop and area when switching to another ewin.

-added sound "SOUND_FOCUS_SET" to be played when the focus is set.

-added win_op title to the IPC stuff.

-changed keybindings to reveal deskmenu and taskmenu.

-changed menus to remove -geom params on netscape calls (personal pref)

I will start working on the IPC stuff that has the create/modify/delete
functions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Window Groups :)

E's windows can new be grouped by opening the winops menu for a
window, and selecting 'Window Group'->'Start Group'. Windows can be added
using 'Window Group'->'Add to group'. There's a control dialog for groups
via 'Window Group'->'Configure group', which defines what actions are
applied to all group members. Moving groups should work in every method
except for translucent, which is turned into opaque.

The pagers by default are a group. 
	
The group members can be emphasized using 'Window Group'->'Show/Hide Group',
doing so again returns to the previous borders. Which borders are used for
emphasizing is defined by a tag __BORDER_GROUP_NAME <bordername> for every
border in the theme. Still needs to be added to BrushedMetal.

Also corrected a typo. Or two, or three ... ;)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mon Jul 26 16:09:13 PDT 1999
(Mandrake)

cleaned up a little bit (especially in actions.c -- there was a spot where i
was being used from a previous context but being reset inside of a closure - I
HAVE to assume that was a mistake).  Also took out a couple of warnings.
Expect a new version of kde.c when I get home, also -- time to commit
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

guess what... i'm back... and the iconbox is almost 100% done... sorry no
example icondefs.cfg files yt to demo the app window -> micon image matching...
but i'll include that later... just trust me that it all works.

the icobox now does a hell of a LOT and is very configrable and malleble. set
the right options and it'd look and feel almost exactly like the old 
iconification stuff except with enhancements and better behavior.

at least now you can have multpile iconboxes, create and destroy them at will
and chnage all the options int he iconbox and e will remember and save/load
this info up again.

quite nice actually... :) try it out - sorry - snapshotted windows only for
those of you not evil enuf to read e's code to figure out thr iconfdefs.cfg

this adds create/modify/delete ability to the
background ipc command. Its using the format, Troy suggested on e-develop,
though it might easily be changed to the "old" style system.

It is using a new value type system as well, which is working the following
way:

        background TEST bg.file /home/test/test.png

will create a background (resp. modifying it, if it already exists) and set
bg.file property to the specified file.

This way takes advantage over the way to provide parameters as the set_bg
command from comms.c works as one does not have to hack in every single
parameter. On the other side, it is a real mess, if one wants to set a whole
bunch of options at once. I have no idea how to solve that discrepance at the
moment. Suggestions are welcome.

The tooltip icons are back. Add tooltip text to the actions in an
action class using __TOOLTIP_ACTION_TEXT "whatever" and you get the mouse
button and key combination visualized for free :) See BrushedMetal's
window titlebar for an example. Theme designers can override the icon
looks by providing imageclasses named: TOOLTIP_MOUSEBUTTON_ANY,
TOOLTIP_MOUSEBUTTON_1, TOOLTIP_MOUSEBUTTON_2, TOOLTIP_MOUSEBUTTON_3,
TOOLTIP_KEY_SHIFT, TOOLTIP_KEY_LOCK, TOOLTIP_KEY_CTRL, TOOLTIP_KEY_MOD1
TOOLTIP_KEY_MOD2, TOOLTIP_KEY_MOD3, TOOLTIP_KEY_MOD4, TOOLTIP_KEY_MOD5.

Ok, quite some stuff:

:) Fixed window shading: it can now really be turned on and off.
:) Having a window shaded and switching the border to one that
   shades to another direction works properly now.
:) Changed the layout management of the Remember dialog a bit to avoid
   a problem that Hall Stevenson reported to the list. Also added a nice
   pic ;)
:) Lots of internal changes to window groups, they're now a list type and
   pointered in both directions: an ewin in a group has a pointer to a
   group, the Group has a list of EWin pointers that are group members.
:) Added dialog for picking the group a window shall belong to. See
   'Window Group'->'Select group to add to'. Maybe the layout could be
   nicer.
:) Groups are remembered now. Therefore, pagers are no longer a group
   by default, but you can make them a group and have that group be
   remembered. See the 'Remember' dialog settings. Should work, but I tested
   it only for a day or so.
:) I turned that menu onscreen appearance thing into an option, since
   I'm not too happy with it. I'm used to just left-clicking on the
   desktop for getting an Eterm, and if I do that now and the cursor
   happens to be near the screen edge, I get ee or whatever. I turned
   it on by default though :)

Hope you like it folks.

Hey, finally. Windows can be in multiple groups now. Needed lots
of changes in the dialogs. The default settings for group options
are now configurable through control.cfg and a dialog.

Added group-overriding actions, but haven't tested them enough.
Some cosmetics for the TODO list. Also fixed some bugs in
showing/hiding groups and changing borders for shaded wins in a group.

In the code, there are a lot more options now for getting groups,
e.g. get all the groups, only the ones a window belongs to or
all except the ones that it belongs to etc.

Paranoia checks for groups shouldn't allow adding a window to a group
multiple times anymore, the current_group is protected better, plus
some more.

Updating BrushedMetal still necessary.
	
The timestamp thing in groups.c (g->index = (int)(GetTime() * 100))
doesn't seem to work for me, every group gets an index of -INT_MAX,
so I changed that a little bit. Hope that's ok?

Sorry that things took me so long .. more small commits surely would
have been better.

IMPORTANT TODO ITEM:   kde support and desktops other than 0 cause things to 
segfault.
Needs fixing.  BIG bug.  if you turn "kde off" in your eesh it will fix that,
or if you want kde support only use desktop 0 for now.  'nuff said.

Changes to the memory allocation stuff to make it more portable and
such.  Account for all the different ways they could be called and
do the rerouting ourselves so we don't depend on the OS.

added important TODO item for kde support :

mandrake:   um, don't use close from the kpanel menu right yet.  that's a bad idea.  in fact, I wouldn't use ANY of the kpanel windowops things yet.  (nasty)

Added Ganymede, finally. Noticed one little bug in it: In the
Desktop Background Settings there's a single transparent line
on the bottom. Couldn't work my way around it.

Sorted the list of window borders in the 'Set Border Style'
menu.

Added some group issues to TODO file. I hope I get to finish that
during this week.

Ok, groups behave inconsistent if you use them over
multiple desktops and via the titlebar or the menu,
so group effects are limited to the current desktop
for now.
