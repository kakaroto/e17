This Documentation is intended to take you step by step through Enlightenment
and its default setup, how to use it, modify settings, and put it to use for
you. When you have finished reading each page please press the NEXT button on
the top of this window to go to the next page, or use the Back button until you have reached the _Docs_Index(docindex)
<p>
If you are reading this right now you have managed to get Enlightenment itself
installed correctly and are either running Enlightenment for the first time or
have just upgraded to a new version. Congratulations. Now it's time to take
you on a quick tour of the desktop you will have before you.
<p>
Please remember that if you use a _theme(themes) other than the default
(Brushed Metal) that it may look slightly or completely different to the 
contents of this User Documentation. Some behavior may also vary.
<p>
To relaunch this Help Browser at any time, middle click on your
_desktop(desktops) and select the "Help" Item.  The documentation should come
back up, reloading to the first page.  
You can also use the "Home" key to take you back to the introduction page at
any time during the program.

Enlightenment is your Window Manager. The Window Manager controls the 
appearance of the borders of your windows, their behavior and
all user interaction with positioning, killing, resizing, moving, iconifying,
shading etc. your windows, virtual desktops, multiple desktops, menus attached
to windows and some root window menus and can also control the background
of your desktop(s).
<p align=50%>
Enlightenment is a large and complex program and is by no means perfect,
but it is being worked on and is as stable as possible. It has many advanced 
features, but may also be missing some features that you would like to see.
The version you are now running (0.16.7) is by no means the
end of development and improvements, fixes and new exciting features are
being worked on all the time. Please visit the 
<br>
_Web(web) site often for
new versions, fixes, patches and updates.
<p align=50%>
We hope that you enjoy using Enlightenment as much as we have enjoyed writing
it.  We'd like to think that even if this isn't the right software for you, you
at least can have fun playing around with what we have created.

A big thanks to several companies that helped support Enlightenment.
<p>
Red Hat Software (www.redhat.com) for allowing developers resources and time
to work on Enlightenment.
<br>
VA Linux Systems (www.valinux.com) for providing hardware, bandwidth, Coke, and
the patience to hire a couple of loony bin candidates to work on something we
(and hopefully you) think is interesting.
<p>
Xi Graphics (www.xig.com) for providing X servers to test out code on.
<p>
Not only should these people be thanked, but the whole E community - those on
the E mailing list, on #E on IRC on openprojects.net and all E users who have provided
feedback and debugging information, bug-fixes, patches and support. A big
thanks goes out to all of you who make a project like this possible.
<p>
In addition we'd like to thank several other projects - such
as XFree86, Imlib, Esound, Freetype and many others, The people working on 
these equally important projects should not be forgotten.

<p>
There is an Official Enlightenment IRC channel where you can go and "hang out"
if you want - talk to other E users, developers, get some help, drool 
together, or whatever. #E will kill me for this but get onto any
openprojects irc server (irc.openprojects.net) then join #E. For example:
<p>
epic4 your_nick irc.openprojects.net<br>
<br>
or<br>
<br>
irc your_nick irc.efnet.org<br>
<br>
or use your favorite graphical IRC client.
<p>
Please remember that it can get busy with 100's of people talking at once.
Not everyone is actually listening all the time or are in the middle of a 
conversation. Be polite and patient, and have a sense of humor and you'll
have fun.

<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<img src=E_screen_start.png x=16 y=16>
<p>
Now that you have started Enlightenment, if you are using it for your desktop 
shell, your screen should look something like the image here on the left.
<p>
Across the whole top of the screen you will see a bar with arrows pointing 
up and down on the left and right ends. This is your desktop 
_Dragbar(dragbar) . 
<p>
On the bottom-left you'll see 3 boxes. The top box with the scrollbar attached
will be your _Iconbox(iconbox) .
<p>
The other 2 boxes below it are _Pagers(pager) for desktops 0 and 1. Everything
else is your desktop background.







<page columns=1 padding=16 name=rootmenu background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<img src=E_app_menu.png x=350 y=38>
<font face=rothwell/25 color=#ffffff>
<p>
Using Menus
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
When you click with your left mouse button on the desktop _background(backgrounds) you will
see an "User Menus" menu appear (example displayed on the right here). 
Applications you may have installed will appear in this menu. To launch one 
of them simply select it from the menu.
<p>
Note: Menus in Enlightenment work like most menu systems. Either hold 
down the mouse button and navigate with the button down, releasing on the
selection you want, or release elsewhere to not select anything. You can also
quickly click and release, then navigate: move the mouse, and click
again on the item you wish to select, or elsewhere if you do not wish to
select an entry.
<p>
To "stick" a menu up and leave it up so you can select items from
it multiple times, click and hold down the mouse and release on the title of
the menu (if it has one) and it will remain up. You can move it and
manipulate it like a normal window. Close the window to unstick the menu.







<page columns=1 padding=16 name=tut4 background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<img src=E_settings_menu.png x=285 y=235>
<img src=E_enlightenment_menu.png x=4 y=30>
<p>
<br>
Clicking the middle button on the desktop _background(backgrounds) will display 
Enlightenment's main menu. You can access the other menus plus more options
from this menu (including those to log out, restart and display Help 
information). A sample of this menu is shown to our left.
<p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
When you click the right mouse button
a menu with the title "Settings" will appear. This is
Enlightenment's _settings(settings) menu. From it you can select various
configuration dialogs that will assist you in customizing your desktop to 
better suit your needs.







<page columns=1 padding=16 name=mousebind background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<font face=rothwell/25 color=#ffffff>
<p>
Mouse Bindings
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
Of course, when you click on the _desktop(desktops) _background(backgrounds) of
your screen, normally you will bring up a _menu(rootmenu).  And of course, when you
click on the _border(border) of a window, you will do various things.  But these
are not the only things you can do with your mouse.
<p>
In Enlightenment, there are several other actions that the mouse can do by
default.  For example, by holding down the ALT key when you click the left
mouse button anywhere in a window, you will find that you can _move(movemode) the window
around the screen, just as if you had used the titlebar.  You can also ALT
middle-click in a window to _resize(resizemode) it, or use ALT and right-click to bring up
the _Window_Operations_Menu(windowops) .
<p>
You will find that holding down the ALT key while clicking the middle 
mouse button on the background of your _desktop(desktops) will bring up a 
menu with the titles of all currently active
application windows. Selecting one of these will take you to that application.
By using the CTRL key instead of ALT you will get a menu displaying all 
current desktops as sub-menus, with applications on each desktop in the 
desktop sub-menu.
<p>






<page columns=1 padding=16 name=mouseconfig background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<font face=rothwell/25 color=#ffffff>
<p>
Mouse Configuration
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<p>
<br>
<br>
Enlightenment makes extensive use of the mouse.
However, you may be missing some features because of the way
that your mouse is configured on your X server.
<p>
If your mouse does not have a middle button you should enable
"Emulate 3 Buttons" in your X server. This option allows you to
emulate a three-button mouse by pressing both left and 
right mouse buttons at once.
If this does not work, three-button emulation  may not be enabled. See
your X server documentation to configure this emulation.
<p>
This may vary from system to system. The OS and X server may also 
vary the method in which you do this, if it is possible. Not having 
a middle mouse button in 
Enlightenment, or for that matter X, is not a good thing as it is almost 
assumed to be there, and is used by many applications, including E.







<page columns=1 padding=16 name=tut6 background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<img src=E_mousewheel.png x=370 y=30>
<img src=E_mouse.png x=410 y=330>
<p>
If you have a Wheel-Mouse and X is configured to use it, Enlightenment
supports it by default.
<p>
Rolling your wheel up on the desktop background will take you back a 
_desktop(desktops) . Rolling your wheel downward you will advance 
forward a desktop.
<p>
If this doesn't work, then it may be you haven't configured your X server to
understand a mouse with a wheel. If you use XFree86 you may need to edit your 
XF86Config to have a "Pointer" Section like:
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ccaacc>
<p>
Section "Pointer"<br>
Protocol    "MousemanPlusPS/2"<br>
Device      "/dev/mouse"<br>
ZAxisMapping 4 5<br>
Buttons      5<br>
EndSection
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<p>
You may need to modify this for your mouse.







<page columns=1 padding=16 name=border background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<font face=rothwell/25 color=#ffffff>
<p>
Using the Window Border
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
When you start an application, unless it has special properties, it will come 
up on your screen with a border surrounding it that contains a titlebar and
several control buttons.
This border is the primary interface to controlling an application window.
The Default setup (shown on the next page) gives adequate control but still
retains simplicity.
<p>
If you click left mouse button on the titlebar and keep the mouse button down
the window will follow your mouse wherever it moves. Respectively if you click
your left mouse button and drag on any of the resize handles, the window will
be resized in that direction. Clicking right mouse button on the resize
handles will raise the windows to the top.
<p>
Clicking right mouse button on the titlebar or any button on the window 
operations menu button on the top-left will display a menu that has window 
manipulation options in it. 
<p>
Double-Clicking (clicking the mouse twice in succession really fast) will
make the Window shade or unshade (depending if it was unshaded or shaded to 
start with).






<page columns=1 padding=16 name=tut8 background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<img src=E_window_diagram.png x=16 y=48>
<p>






<page columns=1 padding=16 name=tut9 background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<p>
Clicking left mouse button on the iconify button will iconify the window
and send it off to the _Iconbox(iconbox) . Hitting the Maximize button will
maximize the
size of the application fill your screen. Hitting it again will Unmaximize, 
bringing the window back to its normal size.
<p>
Clicking with the left mouse button on the close button will close the window.
If the application that owns that window does not respond to a nice request to
exit, then press the right mouse button on the close button to forcibly
terminate that window. This should not be used unless the application is 
visibly "hung".
<p>
In addition to these methods, there are additional ways to manipulation
windows.
<p>
If you hold down the ALT key and hold down left mouse button anywhere in the
window (on the border OR in the application part) while dragging, you will 
move this window around. Doing the same but with the middle mouse button will
resize the window in that direction. Clicking the right mouse button anywhere 
in the window while holding down the ALT key will bring up the window 
operations menu.



<page columns=1 padding=16 name=changeborder background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<img src=E_border_selector.png x=300 y=40>
<font face=rothwell/25 color=#ffffff>
<p>
Changing Window Borders
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<p>
From time to time you may find that you don't like a particular border that a
window uses, for some reason or another.  You can easily change the border
style of a window in Enlightenment using the 
<br>
_Window_Operations(windowops)
menu, however.  Select the "Set Border Style" menu, and a list will be
presented to you of available borders in this theme.  The most common use
for this is to make an application shed its border, using the
BORDERLESS border type.
<p>
You can always click with ALT + Right mouse button anywhere in the window to 
bring up the window operations menu again.
<p>
If you want to remember the border style for the next time you run this 
application, you can always use the _Remember(properties) dialog to remember 
the current window border.

<p>
Note: Zooming in and out of windows will only work if you have an XFree86 
server or one that implements the Xf86VidMode extension. You also need
to define lots of screen modes for your display, so ensure your "Display" 
subsection of your XF86Config looks like:
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ccaacc>
<p>
SubSection "Display"<br>
	Depth 16<br>
	Modes "1600x1200" "1280x1024" "1152x864" "1024x768" "800x600" "640x480" "512x384" "400x300" "320x240"<br>
EndSubSection
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<p>
Have a "Display" subsection per depth (this example is for 16 bit) and all
the resolutions defined as above.







<page columns=1 padding=16 name=desktops background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<font face=rothwell/25 color=#ffffff>
<img src=E_deskstack.png x=360 y=70>
<p>
Multiple & Virtual Desktops
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<p>
Enlightenment supports both Multiple and Virtual desktops. There are
distinct difference between the two, and Enlightenment treats them differently.
<p>
When you start Enlightenment you will by default have two desktops. In
Enlightenment desktops are geometrically unrelated work areas. They are 
visually stacked on top of each other and can even be dragged down to expose
desktops underneath.
<p>
The best way to imagine this is that each desktop is a sheet of paper with the
first desktop (desktop 0) being glued in-place. You can re-shuffle the stack
of papers and slide one down to reveal a piece of paper underneath - the only
paper you can't slide is the first one. Each desktop (or sheet) contains your
application windows.







<page columns=1 padding=16 name=desktops2 background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<img src=E_deskarray.png x=350 y=140>
<p>
Windows normally live on one desktop, but can be made
to exist on all desktops - whenever you change to a new desktop the window
will follow you and be on that desktop too. This is known as being sticky.
if a window is sticky it will "stick to the glass of your screen" and stay
there until it is not sticky anymore or the window is closed.
<p>
Virtual desktops (also known as desktop areas) is a measure of how big your
desktops are. A desktop can be a multiple of your screen size in size (2x1, 
2x2, 3x3, 4x2 etc.). That means each desktop has an AxB screen size of area
allocated to it and you can be looking at any screen-sized part of it at any 
time. It's just like getting more sheets of paper and taping them to the sides
of your current sheet of paper. An easy way of changing your view is by just
sliding your mouse in the direction of a currently unviewable part of your
desktop. As long as you have Edge Flip enabled Enlightenment will 
automatically scroll over to that part of the desktop.



<page columns=1 padding=16 name=desktops3 background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<img src=E_virtual_desk_settings.png x=335 y=51>
<img src=E_area_settings.png x=30 y=190>
<p>
To change the number of virtual desktops that you have, use the "Multiple
Desktop Settings" dialog from the right mouse _settings_menu(settings) .  You
should see a menu that looks something like the menu to the right.  You can use
the slider bar to quickly select the appropriate number of virtual desktops you
would like to use.
<p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
To change the number of virtual areas, use the "Virtual Desktop Settings"
menu.  This will bring up a menu that looks something like the one on the left.
Use the slider bars to extend the size of the virtual areas to the size that
you prefer. You can also use this dialog to enable/disable edge
resistance (when your _mouse(mousebind) hits the edge of an area) moving between
virtual areas.



<page columns=1 padding=16 name=desktops4 background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<img src=E_deskimg.png x=275 y=81>
<p>
Enlightenment also allows you to set a different desktop backdrop per desktop
to help you customize your environment and differentiate which desktop is 
which.
<p>
An easy way of having Enlightenment automatically pick up any pictures you have
is to make a directory in your ~/.enlightenment directory called
backgrounds and then fill that with your favorite backdrops. Enlightenment
will automatically discover this and index them for you allowing you to
select them and change their settings. More on this topic is explained in the

Changing Desktops
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<p>
There are several ways that you can change your current desktop - let's go over
a few of them here.
<p>
You can use the _Keybindings(defkeys) alt-F1 through alt-F12 for the first 12
desktops.<br>
You can use the _Keybindings(defkeys) Ctrl-Alt-Left and Ctrl-Alt-Right to
navigate to the next/previous desktop.<br>
You can use the _Keybindings(tut11) shift-alt-directional arrow to change
virtual areas in a given direction.<br>
You can use the _Pager(pager) to quickly navigate to the desktop/area you want
by clicking on the desired area.<br>
You can use the _Dragbar(dragbar) to quickly navigate to a particular
application or a particular desktop by using the middle and right mouse
buttons.<br>
You can also use external applications such as the GNOME panel's pager or the
KDE panel's pager to navigate desktops and/or applications.<br>


<page columns=1 padding=16 name=appsdesk background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<font face=rothwell/25 color=#ffffff>
<p>
Moving Applications Between Desktops
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
There are several ways that you can move applications from one desktop to
another.  We'll go over a few of them now.
<p>
The first way you can move apps between desktops is using the _Pager(pager) .
<p>
You can also move applications between desktops using the
<br>_Dragbar(dragbar) .
<p>
You can also move applications between desktops using the KDE or GNOME
desktop pagers.
<p>
You can also _move(movemode) a window, then bring the window with you as you
change desktops using _keybinding(defkeys) .


<page columns=1 padding=16 name=dragbar background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<font face=rothwell/25 color=#ffffff>
<img src=E_dragbar.png x=10 y=345>
<img src=E_dragging_desktops.png x=315 y=20>
<p>
The Dragbar
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<p>
If you look along the top of your screen, you will notice a long thin bar that
looks something like the bar pictured below.  This is called your Dragbar.  It
gets its name from its primary purpose, which is dragging desktops around. 
<br>
If
you are on any desktop except desktop 0, you can pick up and move that desktop
in another direction.  _Desktops(desktops) documentation has more information
on how to change desktops.  Once you have dragged a desktop down, you can
proceed to move windows between desktops this way, instead of using the
_pager(pager) .
<p>
You can also use the Dragbar to retrieve windowlists.  Use the middle mouse
button to retrieve a windowlist, and the right mouse button for a
windowlist sorted by desktops.







<page columns=1 padding=16 name=pager background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<font face=rothwell/25 color=#ffffff>
<img src=E_pager.png x=320 y=70>
<p>
The Pager
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
Pagers may not be a new idea in desktop environments, but the Pager in
Enlightenment (as seen on the right) is a highly advanced and highly
configurable tool for desktop and window control, as well as a navigation tool.
<p>
The pager lets you see your desktop screen area in miniature. It lets you click
on a certain desktop to "visit" it, click and drag windows around in the pager 
itself to move them about the screen quickly, or between _desktops(desktops) .
In this example, we have two virtual areas.  You can see the current area (the
one with the windows in it) is also highlighted.
<p>
Dragging a window from 
one area of a pager to another will move it there, or to another desktop. 
Dragging it out onto the actual desktop will drop that window right there.
You can also drag a window into the _Iconbox(iconbox) to iconify the window.
<p>











<page columns=1 padding=16 name=pager2 background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<img src=E_pager_settings_menu.png x=8 y=30>
<img src=E_pager_settings.png x=208 y=180>
<p>
Pressing right-mouse button over a blank portion of the pager gets you the 
pager menu, allowing you to change settings.  This will allow you to
set a couple of quick options, as shown on the left.  For more available
options, you can select the "Pager Settings" item, and another dialog will pop
up, that looks like the one below.
<p>
This dialog box will allow you to set all sorts of additional parameters, many
of which can increase the performance of Enlightenment on your system.
Disabling high quality snapshots and/or snapshots in general as well as
continuous updates can seriously improve performance - these features are
intended for high end machines.











<page columns=1 padding=16 name=pager3 background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<img src=E_pager.png x=320 y=220>
<p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
You can resize the pager to make it the size you'd like.  Hold down
ALT and use the middle-mouse button to resize the pager in any direction. Using
left-mouse button while holding ALT and dragging will move the window. Holding
down ALT while pressing right-mouse button, just like any normal window will
get you a window operations menu.
<p>
In the default theme clicking the tab on the right side of the pager with the
arrow pointing right will shade and unshade the pager window horizontally, 
allowing you to hide and unhide the window easily.
<p>
The striped area above this tab on the pager's border is a handle that will
allow you to move the pager about, just like the titlebar of any window.






<page columns=1 padding=16 name=iconbox background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<font face=rothwell/25 color=#ffffff>
<img src=E_iconbox.png x=300 y=90>
<p>
The Iconbox
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<p>
The iconbox is the place the icons for all your iconified windows go.  It is
one method of recovering _minimized(minimized) applications.  Whenever
you iconify or minimize a window it will go into an iconbox and have an icon 
displayed for it there. Clicking on the icon again will de-iconify it.  
<p>
You can have as many icon boxes on your desktop as you want to.  You can create
more by using the Middle Click _Menu(rootmenu) - select Desktop->Create New Iconbox
and a new Iconbox will pop up on your desktop.  Each of these Iconboxes can
have individual configurations, as detailed on the next page.
<p>
You can _move(movemode) the Iconbox around the screen using Alt-Leftclick
on the window, and then moving it to the desired location on the screen.  You
can _resize(movemode) the Iconbox by alt-middleclicking on the window and
then adjusting the size  as described in the _Mouse_Bindings(mousebind)
section.
<p>


<page columns=1 padding=16 name=iconbox2 background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<img src=E_iconbox_menu.png x=300 y=20>
<img src=E_iconbox_settings.png x=10 y=200>
<p>
Clicking the right-mouse button anywhere in the Iconbox will bring up a menu
to configure that iconbox.  This menu will look a little something like the one
here to the right.  This menu allows you to also close the Iconbox or open up
an additional Iconbox.
<p>
To change the settings of an individual Iconbox, we'll use the right mouse
button _menu(mousebind) and select "This
Iconbox Settings" - this should get us a dialog that looks something like the
one  to our left.  You can change the orientation, icon size, scrollbar
options, display policy, base image, and many more options of the Iconbox
from this dialog.  You may choose to change the anchor of
alignment for resizes - play with it until it resizes appropriately for your
Iconbox location.

<page columns=1 padding=16 name=iconbox3 background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<p>
If you want to customize the images used for the icons in your iconbox, there 
is already an example configuration supplied. To make your own configuration
copy the icondefs.cfg file installed in your Enlightenment system config 
directory (/usr/local/enlightenment/config/icondefs.cfg or 
/usr/share/enlightenment/config/icondefs.cfg) to your ~/.enlightenment 
directory and then edit it. On each line you will find 4 fields. The first
field is the image file to be used. The image is searched for in the usual 
search path if it is not an absolute path to the image file. The search path
is in order: ~/.enlightenment, THEME_DIR/, ENLIGHTENMENT_ROOT/config.
<p>
The second field on the line is a shell-glob like match for the title of 
a window.
If this field is irrelevant, NULL is used instead. NB: the only valid wildcard
in the glob pattern is "*". The third field is the NAME property of the window
and the fourth is the CLASS. The order of search priority is last to first,
so the last entry in the file that matches a window's title, name and class 
globs will use the icon image defined on the first line.

<page columns=1 padding=16 name=iconbox4 background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<p>
If you want all windows to have an icon then use:
<p>
"pix/pimage.png" NULL NULL NULL
<p>
This is the most general match for an icon and will match ALL windows. If you
use this make sure it's at the start of the file so it will only match if no 
other matches are found.
<p>
There are several examples of using the globbing and matching in the system
icondefs.cfg file. Use that as a reference for your own additions.

<page columns=1 padding=16 name=minimized background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<font face=rothwell/25 color=#ffffff>
<p>
Recovering Minimized Applications
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<p>
There are several ways to recover an application once you have minimized it.
The most obvious way is to use the<br>
_Iconbox(iconbox) .  Of course, you might
have had some applications in your Iconbox when you accidentally closed it.  Or
maybe you minimized some applications and forgot you didn't have an Iconbox.
Or maybe you don't like the Iconbox and usually use KDE or GNOME's panel to
recover them and forgot to launch them.  Never fear.  You can always
middle click on the _Dragbar(dragbar)
and get a _menu(rootmenu) that will allow you
to recover them.  You can also Alt or Ctrl-Middleclick on the desktop to get
the same menus (in case you don't have a Dragbar anymore).
<p>
Remember, at any time you can always create a new _Iconbox(iconbox) to catch
your applications as they minimize, if you want to re-enable it.  Unfortunately
you'll have to reconfigure it since each Iconbox can have its own
_settings(settings) .





<page columns=1 padding=16 name=properties background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<img src=E_remember_settings.png x=320 y=50>
<font face=rothwell/25 color=#ffffff>
<p>
Remembering Application Properties
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
In the _window_operations(windowops) menu of every window you will see an
entry labeled
"Remember...". If you select this it will bring up the "Remember" dialog for
that window (Note: only one of these dialogs can be active at any one time), as
shown to our right.
<p>
This dialog lets you selectively snapshot certain attributes of that window at
that time and have Enlightenment remember them. You may choose to only remember
some of the attributes, and possibly not have the application started
automatically for you. Choose what you want Enlightenment to remember about that
window and hit "Apply" or "OK" if you don't need the dialog anymore, and
Enlightenment will, the next time that instance of the application is run,
apply the current location, size, border style or any other attribute to
that window. Enlightenment can also launch the application for you upon startup
if you so wish.







<page columns=1 padding=16 name=settings background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<img src=E_settings_menu.png x=240 y=87>
<font face=rothwell/25 color=#ffffff>
<p>
Settings
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
When you click the right mouse button on the desktop background you will pop 
up the Settings menu. From here you can select an aspect of Enlightenment to
configure to your liking. There are too many settings to actually document
fully right now, but the likelihood is if you want a particular behavior from
Enlightenment, it is achievable by merely playing with these options.
<p>
Combinations of options are often required to get the effect you want, so some
experimentation may be required. Do not be frightened. Nothing you can do
can't be undone by simply changing the options back to how they were and 
clicking on Apply again.







<page columns=1 padding=16 name=groups background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<img src=E_group_settings.png x=370 y=255>
<font face=rothwell/25 color=#ffffff>
<p>
Window Groups
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<p>
Sometimes you have a number of windows on your desktop that logically go
together. Enlightenment allows you to group windows
together, so that whenever you change a property of one window in a group,
the change is reflected on the other group members. If you have a group whose
members span multiple _desktops(desktops) , changing a group's property 
affects only windows of that group that are on the current desktop.
<p>
The properties that you can change for an entire group include setting the window
border, iconifying, killing, moving, raising/lowering, sticking and shading of
a window.
<p>
To define what properties are applied to a group by default, you go to the
_settings(settings) menu and pick the "Group Settings" option, which will give
you a dialog window in which you can configure the settings, as shown here on
the right.





<page columns=1 padding=16 name=groups2 background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<img src=E_groups_menu.png x=320 y=25>
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<p>
There are two different methods for manipulating window groups. First, there's a
comprehensive submenu available in each window's operations menu
called "Window Groups".  This menu is shown here on the right.  You also are
able to configure the group individually apart from the default group settings
(as shown on the previous page).
<p>
The second way is the window titlebar, which has the most important options
directly available for convenience. Shift-click to start a group,
Ctrl-clicking to add a window to the youngest group (also referred to as the
"current" group) and Shift-Ctrl-Click to destroying a group. You can also click
the middle mouse button for visualizing the group(s) of a window. Click again
to returning to the previous border.
<p>
Windows can be in multiple groups at the same time, so for many
options you have to indicate which group you are referring to.
Selecting the appropriate checkboxes (showing the group members' titles)
at the top of the dialog windows.


<page columns=1 padding=16 name=backgrounds background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<font face=rothwell/25 color=#ffffff>
<p>
Selecting and Adding backgrounds
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<p>
Often you will want to change the background of a particular desktop.  There
are several ways you can do this.  But of course, to change your desktop,
you'll need to give Enlightenment some graphics to play with.  A desktop
theme may add a background or two to your available selections, but 
most users want to have even backgrounds to choose from.  To add backgrounds to your
selection, make a backgrounds directory under your home directory.  To
do this using most shells you can type
<p>
mkdir ~/.enlightenment/backgrounds
<p>
Once you've done this, you should restart Enlightenment - this can be done
quickly and easily by simply hitting the Ctrl-Alt-End key combination.  When
Enlightenment starts up, it will rescan these directories, and add new files
into the background selector.






<page columns=1 padding=16 name=backgrounds2 background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<img src=E_backgrounds_menu.png x=163 y=107>
<p>
<br>
<br>
Once you have added your backgrounds and restarted Enlightenment, you should be
able to go to the root menu desktop selector.  To get to this menu, middle
click on the desktop, select "Desktop",
and go to Backgrounds.  You should get something that looks similar to the
image  on the right.  From here you will be able to navigate the backgrounds
menus.  
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
(Click next for more information)


<page columns=1 padding=16 name=backgrounds3 background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<img src=E_backgrounds_menu_view.png x=3 y=84>
<p>
<br>
<br>
Once you have opened up the backgrounds menu, you should see something similar
to the image below.  From here, you can put your mouse over any of the images
there, and it will change the desktop background of the current desktop to the
image that you have selected.  
<p>
<br>
<br>
Enlightenment will attempt to choose the best
settings for a particular background, but if it gets it wrong you can always
change the settings by hand.  By bringing up the settings menu with the right
mouse button and selecting the "Desktop Background Settings" item, you can
bring up a dialog that looks something like the one on the next page . . .

<page columns=1 padding=16 name=backgrounds4 background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<img src=E_backgrounds_settings.png x=0 y=0>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
You can use this dialog to change your background, too , as well as fine-tune
all the various settings for each individual background available.










<page columns=1 padding=16 name=tooltips background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<img src=E_tooltips.png x=260 y=65>
<img src=E_tooltip_settings.png x=20 y=245>
<font face=rothwell/25 color=#ffffff>
<p>
Tooltips
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<p>
From time to time, as you use Enlightenment, if you don't remember what does
what, if you keep the mouse still for a little bit a tooltip will pop up.  The
easiest example of this is when you hold the mouse over a _Window_Border(border)
.
<p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
You can disable the tooltips or change the delay before they pop up by
selecting the "Tooltip Settings" dialog from the _settings(settings) menu, as
shown here on the left.




<page columns=1 padding=16 name=audio background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<img src=E_audio_settings.png x=300 y=220>
<font face=rothwell/25 color=#ffffff>
<p>
Audio
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<p>
<br>
<br>
Of course, Enlightenment comes preconfigured to play lots of little blips and
beeps when you do various things on your desktop.  In order to use sound in
Enlightenment, you must have both ESounD and audiofile installed.  You can find
more information about these libraries from http://www.gnome.org.
<p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
You can enable and/or disable sound at runtime simply by selecting from the
_Settings(settings) menu the "Audio Settings" option, which brings up a dialog,
shown here at right.


<page columns=1 padding=16 name=fx background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<img src=E_special_fx_settings.png x=320 y=60>
<font face=rothwell/25 color=#ffffff>
<p>
Special Effects
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<p>
Enlightenment has many features that are configured via the "Special FX"<br>
_settings(settings) dialog.  Here you can configure the _Dragbar(dragbar) ,
various sliding speeds (including the speed of a windowshade), as well as
toggle animation of different features.  You can also configure the method used
for sliding windows, similar to<br>
_resize_modes(resizemode) .  
<p>There are several FX features disabled by default
in a new installation, including the animated display of menus.  You can also
enable saveunders here, which may improve or slow down the performance of
Enlightenment on your X server, depending on server and configuration.


<page columns=1 padding=16 name=focus background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<img src=E_mouse.png x=410 y=330>
<font face=rothwell/25 color=#ffffff>
<p>
Setting the Focus
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<p>
<br>
<br>
Enlightenment offers lots of different options for focusing windows.  By
default, it comes up in sloppy focus mode.  There are two other primary focus
modes supported by Enlightenment - click to focus and pointer focus.
<p>
Click To Focus most people are familiar with.  You click on a window and it
receives the focus from Enlightenment.
<p>
Pointer Focus gives the focus to whichever window the pointer is sitting over
<p>
Sloppy Focus is similar to Pointer Focus, except that if you go over the
_desktop_background(backgrounds) you still are focused on the last window
<p>
Next we'll tell you how to change these settings.


<page columns=1 padding=16 name=focus2 background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<img src=E_focus_settings.png x=320 y=30>
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<p>
<br>
<br>
Enlightenment allows you to change your focus settings at any time.  Simply
bring up the _Settings(settings) menu and then select "Focus Settings" to bring
up a dialog that looks something like the one on the right.  At the top, we can
select between our three focus modes, as described on the previous page.
<p>
We can also enable some other features, such as one that will allow a simple
_mouse(mousebind) click to raise any window to the foreground, as well as several
other advanced focus settings.
<p>
Here we can also enable the focuslist feature.  This feature requires Xkb to be
enabled in your X server.  If you don't have Xkb enabled, please consult your X
server documentation to see how to do this.  The focuslist is a 
window list that pops up
as you cycle through your focus using the ALT + TAB<br>
_Keybinding(defkeys) .


<page columns=1 padding=16 name=movemode background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<img src=E_move_resize_settings.png x=300 y=50>
<font face=rothwell/25 color=#ffffff>
<p>
Moving Windows
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<p>
Enlightenment comes with several different available methods for moving a
window.  You can perform the actual moves using the  Window
<br>
_Border(border), or by using the available
<br>
_Mouse_Bindings(mousebind) .  This will cause the window to move until you have
released the mouse button.
<p>
To change the mode that the moving of the windows uses (opaque being the
default), open up the _Settings(settings) menu, and select "Move & Resize
Settings".  You can select from a list that looks similar to the one here 
above-right.  Experiment until you find one that suits you best.
<p>
For some serious eyecandy, try out the Translucent move mode.  This will only
work if your X server and Enlightenment are running on the same machine,
however.


<page columns=1 padding=16 name=resizemode background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<img src=E_move_resize_settings.png x=300 y=50>
<font face=rothwell/25 color=#ffffff>
<p>
Resizing Windows
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<p>
Enlightenment also comes with several available methods for resizing windows.
You can perform the actual resize on the window by clicking on any
resize-handle of your window _border(border) and dragging to the desired size.
You can also get the same effect by using the ALT + middle button
_mouse_binding(mousebind) in any part of the window.
<p>
To change the mode that the resizing of the windows uses (opaque being the
default), open up the _Settings(settings) menu, and select "Move & Resize
Settings".  You can select from a list that looks similar to the one here 
above-right.  Experiment until you find one that suits you best.
<p>
The best eyecandy resize mode is probably technical move mode.  This mode shows
you the height and width of the window, in addition to the distance from the
nearest edge.

<page columns=1 padding=16 name=windowops background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>

<font face=rothwell/25 color=#ffffff>
<p>
The Window Operations Menu
<p>
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
The Window Operations menu is a commonly used menu that allows you to perform
many different actions onto the current window.  
<p>
The Close function closes the window in question.
Annihilate destroys the window without
regard to the application the window belongs to, which is especially useful if
the application refuses to respond to being closed with Close. 
<p>
The Iconify function iconifies the window.
If you have an 
<br>
_Iconbox(iconbox)
it is sent to the nearest one.
<p>
The Raise function raises the window above any windows 
that may be obscuring it and Lower 
lowers it below windows it is obscuring. 
<p>
More on the _next(windowops2) page.

<page columns=1 padding=16 name=windowops2 background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<p>
Shade/Unshade toggles the shaded state of the window. Note that borderless
windows are not allowed to be shaded.
<p>
Stick/Unstick toggles the sticky state of a window. A window that is sticky 
remains "stuck to the glass" and thus is visible on all virtual and 
multiple _desktops(desktops) .
<p>
Fullscreen/Window _zooms(tut11) in and out of the window changing resolutions 
if possible. This feature will only work if you have your X server configured
correctly and it supports the XVidtune extension. Your X server may not like
having resolutions changed - it is possible that an unstable X server could 
crash if you use this. Be aware of this when using this feature.
<p>
Remember... displays the _Remember_Properties(properties) dialog that lets
you select things to remember about this instance of an application. The 
attributes selected to be remembered in the state they are when you hit Apply or
Ok in this dialog. You will have to bring it up again if you wish to remember
a new state of the window.
<p>
More on the _next(windowops3) page.

<page columns=1 padding=16 name=windowops3 background=Edoc_bg.png linkcolor=#88dddd>
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<p>
In the _Window_Groups(groups) submenu there are various options for
configuring window
groups and how this window relates to any groups you may have. Note that you
cannot group _Pagers(pager) windows or _Iconboxes(iconbox) together with 
each other or any other windows.
<p>
You can quickly modify the size of a window to one of several aspects of 
maximum sizes using the Window Size submenu.
<p>
Set Stacking lets you change the stacking layer of that window.
<p>
You can change the _border(changeborder) using the Set Border Style menu if
you wish to use a different window border. If you change themes after you have 
changed the border, and the new theme doesn't provide a border of the same

change it again.

Window Placement and Autoraise
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<p>
These two _Settings(settings) dialogs allow you to configure various options
for the placement of windows.  The two Dialog window options are for windows
like the ALT+O open URL window in Netscape.  Manual Placement will force you to
use the mouse to position every new window that attempts to map itself.
<p>
The Autoraise settings Dialog will allow you to set a timer event that causes a
window to automatically raise itself to the foreground after a set time.  You
can enable it here, as well as change the timer.  This is only useful in the
sloppy and pointer _focus_modes(focus) .

<p>
Enlightenment and IPC
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<p>
Enlightenment has a fairly interesting IPC system that allows external
applications (such as Eterm) to talk to Enlightenment and both ask for
information and change information.  There is a program that was installed with
Enlightenment called "eesh" that is a simple shell interface to the IPC in
Enlightenment.  It's even got its own documentation.  You can go into
eesh and type "help" and it should spit back a list of commands that it
understands.
<p>
Note: there are many commands that will show up in E's IPC that don't
necessarily work yet, or aren't fully implemented.  You CAN potentially do some
really bizarre things to your system by using eesh, but for the most part it's
just another interesting interface to E.  In your distribution package you
should have received some sample scripts written in Perl that interface to E
through eesh showing how you can externally script E to do more things outside
E's base functionality.  Expect the IPC to flesh out even more in future
revisions.
<br>
To exit eesh, hit CTRL + D (EOF)

<p>
Editing Enlightenment's Menus
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<p>
The first time you run Enlightenment as a user after you've installed it, it
should create a directory under your home directory called .enlightenment.  In
this directory, there will be a file called "file.menu" - this file controls
the contents of your left-mouse button _Menu(rootmenu) .  The very first line
of this file contains the title for the menu, and the remainder of the file
looks something like this:
<font face=aircut3/10 color=#112222>
<p>
"Eterm" NULL exec "Eterm"
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<p>
Where each column represents:
<font face=aircut3/10 color=#112222>
<p>
Entry title , graphic for menu (or NULL) , exec "commandline"
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<p>
You may have several files in here, including a KDE menu and a Gnome menu if
Enlightenment has detected their presence during installation.  If
detected, your primary apps will be located in another file called
user_apps.menu.  Each of these files is for you to edit as desired.

Editing Your Keybindings
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

To set your own keybindings, all you have to do is find the keybindings.cfg
file that was installed with Enlightenment, and make a copy in your
~/.enlightenment directory.  This file is fairly long, but shouldn't be too
difficult to edit.  Be careful!  The keybindings in this file will override ALL
the default keybindings, as long as this file exists, so edit this file with
extreme caution (unless you know what you're doing).
<p>
To reset your keybindings back to the default, simply remove this file from
your ~/.enlightenment directory.  The next time you restart Enlightenment
it should reload the default keybindings into memory.

<p>
Enlightenment and Themes
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<p>
One of the strong points of Enlightenment, of course, is that you can change
around the complete look and feel of your desktop whenever you want to.
Included with the 0.16.7 release are a few themes, to show off a little bit of
this configurability.  You can select them by using the middle mouse button
_menu(rootmenu) , going to the "Themes" selector, and then choosing a new
theme.  Of course, there are plenty more themes for Enlightenment than come
with it by default.  You can find more by going to:
<p>
http://e.themes.org
<p>
and searching around until you find something you like.  
<p>
To install a new theme
is simple: all you need to do is take the bleh.etheme file and drop it into
your<br>
~/.enlightenment/themes<br>
directory.  Once you've restarted Enlightenment,
it will automatically show up in your Themes _menu(rootmenu), and you can
choose it just like any other theme.

Enlightenment's Eyecandy Features
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<p>
<br>
<br>
Of course, Enlightenment wouldn't be complete without just a few bits of
eyecandy to play with.
<p>
On the "Special FX" _settings(settings) dialog you can chose two toys:
<p>The ripples effect - this causes little ripplets of water to reflect on the
bottom of your screen.
<p>The waves effect - similar to ripples, but this one waves up and down as
opposed to side-to-side
<p>
<br>
On the "Desktop Background" _settings(settings) dialog you can enable "Theme
Transparecy". A slider controls the opacity of the window borders, etc. with
respect to the desktop background.

<font face=rothwell/25 color=#ffffff>
<p>
Included Maintenance Scripts
<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<p>
Enlightenment comes with several scripts that are executable out of the middle
mouse button _menu(rootmenu) - these scripts can perform all sorts of
maintenance on the files that Enlightenment creates automatically for you.
When you select "Maintenance" you should get a menu that looks something like
the one above-right.  You can also rebuild the KDE and GNOME menus
Enlightenment uses from here<p>
As a warning, when you purge configuration information, the next time you
restart Enlightenment it will take longer to load.  You can monitor
Enlightenment's usage using the query tools provided.  If you change themes a
lot you will probably want to purge the config file cache after you've settled
on a theme.  This will help keep your disk usage by Enlightenment down.

<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<p>
<br>
<br>
Q: I can't find my _Iconbox(iconbox) or change its settings.
<p>
A: There are two possibilities here.
<p>
1. You don't have an Iconbox on your desktop right now. Just middle-click and 
select Desktop/Create new iconbox
<br>
2. Your Iconbox is transparent and borderless.  Iconify a window and see if
your icon appears.  If so, rightclick on it to reconfigure your Iconbox.
<p>
<br>
<br>
Q:  I Can't Seem To Find My Left Mouse Menu
<p>
A:  Your menu files may be destroyed.  Try rerunning the program that initially
generated them.  First you'll want to remove the ~/.enlightenment/*.menu files.
Rebuild them using the _Maintenance(maint) menu.

<font face=aircut3/12 color=#ffffff>
<p>
<br>
Q:  All My Settings Are Mangled And I Can't Fix It
<p>
A:  Well, if things get really messed up, you can always remove all of
Enlightenment's automatically saved files.  go into ~/.enlightenment, and
remove the ...e_session* files, and then blow away the cached directory.  If
your theme is broken, remove the user_theme.cfg file, also.  The
next time you start Enlightenment it should reset everything to the default.
<p>
<br>
<br>
Q: I Upgraded My Theme, But The New One Isn't Being Used
<p>
A: When you upgrade a theme that does not come with Enlightenment, when you go
into your ~/.enlightenment/themes directory, be sure to delete the unpacked
directory version of your theme that should be sitting next to the theme, if it
is there.  Otherwise when Enlightenment attempts to start the new version it
will use the old files, which causes this problem.

Q:  These Docs Didn't Help, Where Can I Get More Help?
<p>
A: Well, we obviously can't answer all of your questions just by predicting
them, so I would try the _website(web) as well as looking at the
_mailing_lists(email) , especially the mail archives.  Chances are that someone
else has probably had the same problem that you have.  And if all that still
fails, you might try someone on the _irc(irc) channel
