this is e16keyedit.

This is a standalone keybindings editor for enlightenment version 0.16.

It's mostly done, even though I never hooked up the menus to do anything
useful, which maybe I'll go back and do for an 0.2 release, but this 0.1 is
pretty much everything you'll need.

to build the application, use "make".
once you've done that, copy the binary (e16keyedit) to any binary directory
wherever you want to put it.  "make install" doesn't work, so it doesn't
really matter, does it?  *grin*
