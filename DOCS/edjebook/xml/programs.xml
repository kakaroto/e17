<title>Programs: Bring your interface to life</title>

<para>Programs define how your interface reacts to events.  These events can come from Edje, user interaction, or
an external force like your window manager.  All these events come to Edje as signals. Signals from user interaction
would include mouse clicks, key presses and mouse movement.  Signals from an external source would include window
moves, window resizes, or window raises and lowers.  Signals from Edje internally would include programs starting or
stopping, or the loading of an EET.  Each signal must come from some place, whether it is a part or another program or
in the case of a window manager move anywhere.  The place from which a signal come is known as the source.  If
a user left clicks on an image part named "button", a "mouse,clicked,1" signal is generated from the source part "button".
