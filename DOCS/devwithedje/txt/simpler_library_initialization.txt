We have seen initialization functions previously in this chapter and other that 
an increased level of verbosity there is nothing special about the use we have
give them here::

    Evas_Bool
    simpler_init()
    {
        char *path;

        if (ApplicationName == NULL)
        {
            fprintf(stderr, "Error: The application's name was not set.\n");
            return FALSE;
        }

        if (!evas_init())
        {
            fprintf(stderr, "Error: Evas failed to initialize.\n");
            return FALSE;
        }
        ... 

The rest of the initialization functions can be found in the CVS repository, I
decided to show this particular piece because it shows a characteristic of the
framework that can become a problem. Having an application's name setup is a 
requeriment of Ecore_Config. It uses that name to search for or create a 
configuration directory and file. Unless it was explicitly altered by the 
developer the default location of the configuration file will be 
``$HOME/.e/apps/ApplicationName/config.eet``. Once the application's name has 
been set, we are safe to work with Ecore_Config::

        ...
        ecore_config_theme_default("theme/default", "default");
        ecore_config_theme_default("theme/current", "default");
        if (ecore_config_load() != ECORE_CONFIG_ERR_SUCC)
        {
            fprintf(stderr,"Warning: Could not load config from ~/.e/apps/%s/config.eet\n", ApplicationName);
        }
        path = ecore_config_theme_with_path_get("theme/default");
        if (path == NULL)
        {
            fprintf(stderr,"Error: The default theme, '%s.edj', was not found in the PATH='%s'.\n", ecore_config_theme_get("theme/default"), ecore_config_theme_default_path_get());
            return FALSE;
        }
        return TRUE;
    }

An excellent introduction to Ecore_Config already exists in the EFL Cookbook
and I won't replicate here. But I will resume the functions used in this code
sample. The first function called is ``ecore_config_theme_default`` and it's 
used to setup the default value for a given theme configuration item, don't 
worry, the specifics of "theme configuration items" are explained further down 
this book. In any case, setting up a default value is useful to ensure a valid 
value in case the configuration file is non-existent or incomplete.

Right after setting some default values we use ``ecore_config_load`` to load
the configuration file found in the default location mentioned earlier. It is
a good practice to not use custom file locations for configuration files 
because it eases portability of the application. The user will also apreciate
the additional feeling of certainlity of how an application is going to behave.
Still, the alternative function ``ecore_config_file_load`` could have been used
to load a configuration file from a custom location.

Before finishing sucessfully we will have to control that at least the default 
theme file can be found somewhere. Finding at least one theme file is pretty
much mandatory for any Edje based application.
