First in the config dialog you have two options: 
	(i) Be so smart as win_must_die does, and 
	(ii) be suitable for advanced users like everybody on this list. 

If the first option is selected, then each scrapshot is saved in /tmp, 
or ~/tmp and the preview box is displayed with a thumbanailed scrapshot image, 
and two buttons "Close" and "Save As....". 

In the Advanced case, i'd leave the behaviour of the ss as is.

Option to allow prompting to user of filename to use.
