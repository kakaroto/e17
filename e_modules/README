e_modules is a loose collection of third party E17 modules written by
various authors.  They are not officially a part of E17, but they are
allowed to use the E cvs repository.  The modules are all separate
modules, written by separate authors.

e_modules is not supposed to be treated as a single entity.  While there
is some basic infrastructure for building them all at once, it is merely
for convenience.  If one module is broken, then trying to build them all
at once will fail.    At any given time, one or more might be broken and
wont compile.  Any complaints that "e_modules is broken" will be
directed to read this file and compile the modules one at a time. 
Packagers are strongly advised to not package e_modules as a single
package.  Modules that are broken for more than a few days will be
documented in README.BROKEN.  Modules that are broken for the long term
may be removed.
