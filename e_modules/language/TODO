1. Fix the configure.in file in order to have dependencies to X11 and xkbfile
   libraries.

2. Remove all FIXMEs. Especially in e_mod_lang.c since the code the paths to
   X files are hardcoded. That is not ok.

3. Fix the lang_language_current_kbd_model_get() to return the actual value.

3. Turn on module shortcut bindings. They are turned of for a while.

4. Introduce country flags for the face box, and for the list icons in the config
   dialog and in the face menu.
5. Think on language switch policy :
      a) Global
      b) Per Window
      c) ????
