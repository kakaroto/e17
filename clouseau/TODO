* Make it an elm module (or setting an env var without a module?) so I'll be able to remotely connect to elm apps.
* Split UI and actual program code (better to do the previous bullet first).
* Add "grab screenshot" button.
* Add a clipping range rectangle.
* Add special per object info, for example edje part names?
* When items are coloured, show the exact colour using a rect?
* Handle map/proxy
* add a way to filter object with some regexp on the name and also finding a specific object according to name.
* Add general info like hinting/whole interface scale/finger size and etc.

* Things to show per-object
  * clipping info.
  * callback list?

* EET uses malloc, not stringshare, change stringshare -> strdup
* Fix has_focus.
* Hook on feed events or something and let us see who gets what?
