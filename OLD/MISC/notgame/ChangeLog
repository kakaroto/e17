Wed Aug 25 14:45:07 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Initial work on getting this sucker into CVS.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 25 15:22:08 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	First compilable version.  Doesn't do much yet, though. :-)
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Aug 25 17:05:04 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Some widgets that do stuff....
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 27 20:41:58 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Some initial group stuff.  Values are hard-coded for now.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Aug 30 18:45:20 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Basically, this gives you an idea of how the opening screen will look.
	Not much yet as far as working functionality, though. :-)
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 31 13:03:02 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	This is the first point at which you can actually play the Not Game
	with this program.  All the values are hard-coded, so configuring it
	requires some source code hacking, but it's playable.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 31 16:41:55 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	A working instructions box is now present.  If you're still wondering
	what the Not Game is, read that box ("Help" -> "How to Play...").
	:-)
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 31 17:05:25 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Oops.  Don't create more than one game window.  Thanks mandrake. :)
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Aug 31 19:13:29 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	At this point, the interface is pretty much finalized all around.
	The next step is to write the configuration engine, which will be a
	very pluggable version of Eterm's current parser, but will fix some of
	the flexibility problems in the current parser's design.  Once it's
	completed and tested, I plan to merge the new stuff back into Eterm.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep  2 19:22:21 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Eterm's config parser has been updated, adapted, and incorporated
	into notgame.  It doesn't work yet, and there's still more cleaning up
	to do, but at least the thing compiles and runs now. =)
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep  7 19:20:03 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	More work on the config file parser.  I still have to clean up the
	context switching and the state persistence, but at least it won't
	crash. :-)
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 14 16:11:39 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Got the config parser all fleshed out and working, and I made the
	player/player group section work.  We're about 80% of the way to a
	playable, customizable version.

	See notgame.cfg.dist for a sample config file; copy it to your home
	directory as "notgame.cfg" if you wanna play. :)
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tue Sep 14 19:16:06 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Working towards getting the "play game" data from the right places.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 16 16:56:20 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	The Not Game is now completely playable.  Only a few additions left
	to make (namely, making the "Current Player" label accurate, coding
	the "Add" dialog boxes, and writing a configuration saver).

	Please report any bugs, with debugging output if possible (specify
	--with-debugging when running configure or autogen.sh).
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 16 18:31:52 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	The "Current Player" label works now.  So do computer players.  (If
	you specify a player as "AI" or "computer" in the config file, the
	program will eliminate a restaurant at random each time that player's
	turn comes up.)
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 16 19:30:21 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	You can now save your current configuration.  This will be more useful
	once you can actually add and delete players and destinations. :-)
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mon Sep 27 18:03:41 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Code cleanups to make for a cleaner compile.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thu Sep 30 18:54:47 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Interface changes on the pregame window, and a prototype for a player
	group editing window.  Click on "Add/Delete Players" for a preview.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Oct  1 19:29:09 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	Adding, deleting, and modifying players within a player group works.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Oct  6 16:06:13 PDT 1999	Michael Jennings <mej@eterm.org>

	This is the first fully-playable, fully-functional, full-featured
	version.  It has everything in it that I want to put in for the 1.0
	release.  If you're interested, please put it through its paces.  Let
	me know if you find any bugs.  I've christened it 0.9, signifying that
	it is the 1.0 beta.
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Jan 27 13:35:51 2006                        Michael Jennings (mej)

This guy has gone untouched for a long time and needs a lot of work.
But at least now it compiles and runs (for me anyway).
----------------------------------------------------------------------
