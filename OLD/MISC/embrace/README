About
-----

Embrace is a mail-checker which is based on the Enlightenment Foundation
Libraries.
It monitors your mailboxes and the current count of total and new mails
in them.

Embrace uses Edje for the user interface. Plugins are used for the
mailbox monitoring. Embrace currently ships with plugins for IMAP, POP3,
mbox, maildir and Sylpheed mailboxes.

For more information about the themes, please refer to README in
data/themes/<name>/README.

Installation
------------

Please see INSTALL.


Configuration
-------------

To use Embrace, you will have to create an EDB first, which tells
Embrace what mailboxes you want to have monitored etc.

For an example, please see create_embrace_cfg.sh, which can be found
in the Embrace data directory.


Usage
-----

Just run embrace and watch it monitoring your mailboxes :)
You can force a mailbox check by clicking the mailbox icon with the right
mouse button.
