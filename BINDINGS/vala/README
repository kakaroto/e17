e*.vapi & libeflvala
=====================

e*.vapi contains vala bindings for the
Enlightenment Foundation Libraries.
It is usable with or without libeflvala.

libeflvala contains additional convenience
objects for applications written in vala
using the efl.

Roadmap
=======

Full Elementary support is going to be done first,
adding dependencies (evas) as we go. Later on,
adding edje and ecore for applications that do not
want to use elementary.
