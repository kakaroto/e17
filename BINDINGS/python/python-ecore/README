                      PYTHON BINDINGS FOR ECORE

 * Cython >= 0.13
 * Python-Evas >= 0.7.3

BUILDING AND INSTALLING
=======================

This package uses automake, so execute:

Build::

        ./configure --prefix=/usr
        make all

Install::

        make install

If you wish to install at alternative locations, then make sure to
configure your PYTHONPATH to be able to access this location!

If you have Cython dependencies that are installed in alternative
locations and want Cython to find them, please specify CYTHONFLAGS
variable to ./configure.

The discovery of dependencies is done with pkg-config, thus all your
packages must be properly accessible with such tool. Ensure your
PKG_CONFIG_PATH and PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR (cross-compiles) are configured!

When cross-compiling, if your target's Python headers differ from your
host's headers, specify PYTHON_INCLUDES variable containing the
directory of the correct version of Python.h!
