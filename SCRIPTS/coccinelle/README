Introduction
============

Coccinelle is a tool for making semantic patches, finding patterns in code (and
thus, bugs), maitaining the API/ABI of a library -- also known as collateral
evolutions -- and so on. In Raster's words: "a smart search and replace".

More details about Coccinelle, documentation, example patches, howtos,
presentations etc can be found at http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/

ecocci.h is the file to be passed to Coccinelle as -macro_file_builtins.
It's easier to run against all code base, but you'll achieve better results
if you run individually for each project.

Q&A
===

1) How do I use it?

spatch -sp your-semantic-patch.cocci -macro_file_builtins /path-to/ecocci.h \
       -all_includes -relax_include_path -dir ./

 -sp <file>: give the semantic patch to apply
 -macro_file_builtins <file>: give the .h file with macro definitions
 -all_includes: needed in order to correctly handle #include "file.h"
 -relax_include_path: needed in order to search for header also on current dir
 -dir: the directory to patch

2) How do I know if a macro should be added to ecocci.h?

Run spatch with -parse_c option, it will output something like

        NB total files = 14; perfect = 14; pbs = 0; timeout = 0; =========> 100%
        nb good = 16093,  nb passed = 636 =========> 3.952029% passed
        nb good = 16093,  nb bad = 0 =========> 100.000000% good

If it's not 100% good, then you have some parsing issues. Go up in the parsing
output and find out which macro is causing problems. Then run with
-verbose_parsing with only the file containing that macro. This will give you
a clue on how to fix it.

3) spatch output is too verbose, isn't it?

Yes, I think so. You can get a quiet one with -very_quiet option

4) Where are all the options detailed?

spatch -longhelp is your friend.

5) I've made a patch and I'm almost sure there are some places Coccinelle is
not working as it should. What's happening?
