* Eina
	- implement multiple level of hash for eina_hash depending on number of child.
	- replace inlist by rbtree in chained mempool.
	- improve benchmark (add more real use case, provide option for tracking result more easily)
	- add open/fstat/mmap/munmap/close helper.

* Eet
	- add inheritance

* Evas
	- add _stringshared version for evas_event_feed_*
	- add joystick support
	- cleanup sdl engine
	- add a prepare phase that could be used by all engine when we got many main CPU to prepare font, polygon and load image in parallel (should work also with dsp)
h	- try quadtree support
	- fix Evas_Object_Polygon resize issue and API.

* Edje
	- Add REVERSE to edje possible program action
	- Add continue: (ABORT|CONTINUE|CHAIN) to edje STATE_SET argument
	- Make it possible to catch requested file and to rewrite it
h	- Optimize memory layout thanks to new file format
	- Reuse match automate between edje object of the same type
h	- Add specialized task for each match automate case
	- Add internationalization support
	- Add an optimizer to change edje layout for better performance
	- Add benchmark tools.

* Elixir
h	- add eet -> js object
	- add elementary binding
	- add physique binding
h	- add eio binding
	- use eet connection

* Explicit
	- add server
h	- add client library
	- integrate with edje (so we can request url image from lua, embryo or with USER directive)
	- integrate with elementary

* Efo
	- write module interface
	- write info manipulation library

* Et
	- write basic contact/place efo module
	- write elementary interface (pan + efo)

* Emap
	- write location efo module
	- write extraction code for devs info.txt
	- write elementary interface (pan + efo + maps)

* Eyelight
	- write own layout function
h	- fix expose and thumbnail display to be fully async

* Eio
h	- provide a completly asynchronous IO API using ecore thread infra
	- add notify support
	- use dirfd helper
	- add tutorial
	- add tests suite

* Efreet
	- implement cache with icons directory content to avoid uneeded stat
	(should require a daemon to do the monitoring and the generation for
	every one in the background).

h: half done
