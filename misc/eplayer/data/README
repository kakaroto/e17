######## EPLAYER EDJE GUIDE #########

An ePlayer theme consists of two Edjes:
 * The main Edje, called "eplayer"
 * The playlist item Edje, called "playlist_item"

The "eplayer" Edje emits the following signals:

    action,     SIGNAL_EMIT "PLAY_PREVIOUS" "*";
    action,     SIGNAL_EMIT "PLAY_NEXT" "*";

    action,     SIGNAL_EMIT "PAUSE" "*";
    action,     SIGNAL_EMIT "PLAY" "*";
    action,     SIGNAL_EMIT "STOP" "*";

    action,     SIGNAL_EMIT "SEEK_FORWARD" "*";
    action,     SIGNAL_EMIT "SEEK_BACK" "*";

    action,     SIGNAL_EMIT "TOGGLE_TIME_DISPLAY_MODE" "*";
    action,     SIGNAL_EMIT "TOGGLE_REPEAT_MODE" "*";

    action,     SIGNAL_EMIT "SWITCH_GROUP" "foo";

    action,     SIGNAL_EMIT "QUIT" "*";

    action,     SIGNAL_EMIT "SEEKER_START" "*";
    action,     SIGNAL_EMIT "SEEKER_UPDATE" "*"; 
    action,     SIGNAL_EMIT "SEEKER_STOP" "*";

The "SWITCH_GROUP" signal is special. It will reload the Edje using the
group "foo" (src argument). This way, you can easily implement
collapsed/expanded states etc.

The Edje provides the following parts for text display, etc:

    Part: "title"            -> Window Title
    Part: "artist_name"      -> Name of artist
    Part: "album_name"       -> Name of album
    Part: "song_name"        -> Name of song
    Part: "time_text"        -> Current pos in track ([-]00:00)
    Part: "vol_display_text" -> Current Volume Level (0 - 100)

    Part: "playlist"         -> where to swallow the playlist
    Part: "seeker"           -> draggable set to track position (%)
    Part: "seeker_grabber"   -> special (see below)

The seeker:
  The seeker involves two parts. One, "seeker" is a draggable that gets set to the current song position (as a percent). Often, this can be an invisible part with other parts relative to it (to create a bar, for instance). Second is the "seeker_grabber" part, which captures mouse down/move events to actually seek. Create programs for this part that emit SEEKER_START on mouse down, SEEKER_UPDATE on mouse move and SEEKER_STOP on mouse up. 



The "playlist_item" Edje contains a "title" and a "length" part.

These parts emit the following signals:

    action,     SIGNAL_EMIT "PLAYLIST_SCROLL_UP" "";
    action,     SIGNAL_EMIT "PLAYLIST_SCROLL_DOWN" "";
    action,     SIGNAL_EMIT "PLAYLIST_ITEM_PLAY" "";
    action,     SIGNAL_EMIT "PLAYLIST_ITEM_REMOVE" "";

ChangeLog:

7/28/03: Edje2 Intreface started drawing on the inferface
		of Native Instruments "Traktor DJ Studio"
7/29/03: Interface cleaned up emensly 
7/30/03: Added this README and abstracted signals



To Do:
	-> New controls need to be added (vol control?)
	-> Clipping layer for LCD doesn't work, hides 
		text when used (clip_to, )
	-> Layout methods for Buttons could be better ?
	-> LCD could contain more information and have 
		some seperation
	-> Buttons are currently 2 stage, should be 3-4
	-> Play/Pause buttons should stay down to illistrate
		that you are currently playing.

	-> Play/Pause button should blink when waiting......
