        * src/vorbis.c: track_open() initializes the "time_text"
          part, too
        * src/callbacks.c: when cb_track_next() is called after the
          last playlist item, it moves to the beginning again, without
          starting playback.
        * src/callbacks.c: cb_track_prev() does nothing when it's
          called on the beginning of the playlist

          period now

        * data/eplayer.edc: buttons emit their signals on mouse_up now

          calling ao_close() in track_close()

          The playlist can be scrolled using the mousewheel now

        * src/playlist.c: Fixed a potential segfault
        * src/vorbis.c: Fixed a segfault that occurred when
          play_loop() called open_track() with player->cur_item
          being NULL
