	This is the first point at which you can actually play the Not Game
	with this program.  All the values are hard-coded, so configuring it
	requires some source code hacking, but it's playable.

	A working instructions box is now present.  If you're still wondering
	what the Not Game is, read that box ("Help" -> "How to Play...").
	:-)
