Finally got my ChangeLog script back -- figured I need to start putting some
stuff in here.  Works pretty well right now except for some of gtk/gdk's
stupidness. I think im going to have two drawing areas now actually - one
will be a solid white (or gray) pixmap as a background, I'm thinking this
may fix my exposure problems. Off to school now...

Well, thanks to KainX calling me a pansie, I started rewriting the gui code
WITHOUTH using Glade.  This has shown me something.  Glade is overrated.  It
also fills your code with a bunch of unneeded shit and does some HORRIBLE
formatting :)  Anyway, this has cut the code down by about 500 lines, and
most of the functionality is back now.  Talked to raster, have a solution
for the alpha rendering problem -- this should also speed up image renders a
good bit.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok, TOTAL rewrite of the code -- decided to screw Glade -- just didn't work
the way that I wanted.... but thats ok.. anyway -- shortened the code size
down A LOT.  At least 600 lines.  Fixed bug in opening images from the
File->Open Image menu.  I now have a new bug though.... happens
occasionally, will fix soon - should be a big deal.  You still have to run
ee2 from the ee2 dir, this will be changed by snapshot 3. snapshot 3 will
also have the 'scratch pad' to render on --- this should speed up rendering
and fix some of the problems with rendering alpha'd images.

Ok, I fixed the resizing bug when you go to File->Open Image

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, I'm adding it to CVS now :)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

added an alpha channeled image to test out the alpha rendering... still
need to add the checkerboard 'scratch pad' -- coming soon :)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok, going to File->Save will save the current image now.  Will make Save As
work soon.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok, File->Save As works now... brings up a file selector dialog, type the
name, hit Ok.  Ok, now that I have that out of the way i can work on the
chekerboard stuff.

Took the grotesque looking menubar off of the top of the window... now you
can right click on the image and a menu should come up :)  sounds good I hope.
i have an issue where the window will not be resized properly... open an
image then open a smaller image.... window stays the same... i think i know
what is going on here, but im kinda tired... (sleep is calling).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Removed some uneeded stuff from the function prototypes

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Finally have some of the checkerboard drawing code in there..... pretty much
the same way imlib2_view and feh are doing it....  you dont actually see it
yet though...

Woooooo.... EE2 was giving me illegal instructions last night... scary...
turned out to be one of my CFLAGS....  anyway, the window resize should work
now...  before if you opened an image and then opened an image smaller than
the current image the window would not resize -- now it does.  its the
weekend now so expect the following things to be complete by sunday:

checkerboard background
image browser
ability to accept wildcards

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(dphase)

sometimes you should compile before commiting.... typos and other screw ups
now fixed...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Feb 11 18:52:55 CST 2000
(dphase)

FINALLY!
Ok, ee2 is rendering a checkerboard behind the image now :)
still have a few issues with the checks and exposure events and some
resizing problems.... but that isnt really a major issue -- and its fairly
easy to fix.  off to work on that now :)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fri Feb 11 23:43:49 CST 2000

Added some stuff to the main menu

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Damn. Didnt get as much accomplished this weekend as i wanted.... right now
the image browser is *almost* ready..  im commiting a big chunk of stuff,
but i have a seperate tree here im working on that i dont wont to commit at
the moment since it will break, well, everything (for the time being).  i
should get this up tomorrow - hopefully, but im going to quit setting dates
-- it never works :)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Added preliminary autoconf & autmake stuff.

Fri Feb 18 13:47:56 CST 2000
(dphase)

now accepting wildcards.. (ie, ./ee2 /var/pr0n/*.jpg) and it will show up in
the browsing window, if you dont do a wildcard, the window will not display...

now i need to hook in some callbacks to load the images in the browsing
window... note that this was a small 5 minute hack...

*WARNING* *WARNING*
Do NOT compile this code!!!
I'm trying to fix ee2's rendering code and as of now it is broken.

(and on a lighter note we have new ee2 logo's)  ;)
