Finally got my ChangeLog script back -- figured I need to start putting some
stuff in here.  Works pretty well right now except for some of gtk/gdk's
stupidness. I think im going to have two drawing areas now actually - one
will be a solid white (or gray) pixmap as a background, I'm thinking this
may fix my exposure problems. Off to school now...

Well, thanks to KainX calling me a pansie, I started rewriting the gui code
WITHOUTH using Glade.  This has shown me something.  Glade is overrated.  It
also fills your code with a bunch of unneeded shit and does some HORRIBLE
formatting :)  Anyway, this has cut the code down by about 500 lines, and
most of the functionality is back now.  Talked to raster, have a solution
for the alpha rendering problem -- this should also speed up image renders a
good bit.

Ok, TOTAL rewrite of the code -- decided to screw Glade -- just didn't work
the way that I wanted.... but thats ok.. anyway -- shortened the code size
down A LOT.  At least 600 lines.  Fixed bug in opening images from the
File->Open Image menu.  I now have a new bug though.... happens
occasionally, will fix soon - should be a big deal.  You still have to run
ee2 from the ee2 dir, this will be changed by snapshot 3. snapshot 3 will
also have the 'scratch pad' to render on --- this should speed up rendering
and fix some of the problems with rendering alpha'd images.
