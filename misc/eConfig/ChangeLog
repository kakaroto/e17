figured out how to make "make test" work in here finally.
that was bizarre.  why does gnu like "make check" ?

a little work on the library, too, but still not much here yet

eConfig is about to start taking shape.  starting to begin building the base
system now

a couple of minor API changes.  the API is the important bit people should pay
attention to.  the rest of it isn't as important (but I'm should have a
preliminary beta out today/tomorrow)

Still trying to make the API sane

API editing (slightly).  I have a question - how portable is using time_t?
Anyone care to take that one?  time_t in a file, that is.  I want to be able to
store the last modification date of something NOT as a string.

eConfigGetData() is starting to take shape now - we just have to figure out
what to do about these binary timestamps

adding some comments here and there as I go.  going to try to "Do the Right
Thing" from the ground up this time.

thanks to Hans Lofving <hans.316@brfmasthugget.se> for pointing out that I had
part of my internal API backwards.  Luckily we could repair that :)
