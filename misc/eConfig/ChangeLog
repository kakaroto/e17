Did a path loader.  still not much in here.

figured out how to make "make test" work in here finally.
that was bizarre.  why does gnu like "make check" ?

a little work on the library, too, but still not much here yet

now the paths stuff should actually work.

Playing around with the api a bit.

eConfig is about to start taking shape.  starting to begin building the base
system now

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

a couple of minor API changes.  the API is the important bit people should pay
attention to.  the rest of it isn't as important (but I'm should have a
preliminary beta out today/tomorrow)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Still trying to make the API sane

API editing (slightly).  I have a question - how portable is using time_t?
Anyone care to take that one?  time_t in a file, that is.  I want to be able to
store the last modification date of something NOT as a string.

eConfigGetData() is starting to take shape now - we just have to figure out
what to do about these binary timestamps

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

adding some comments here and there as I go.  going to try to "Do the Right
Thing" from the ground up this time.

thanks to Hans Lofving <hans.316@brfmasthugget.se> for pointing out that I had
part of my internal API backwards.  Luckily we could repair that :)

committing what I did last night before I went to bed.  I don't remember what
this does

A little bit of work here and there.  the API is coming together nicely.  Need
to rethink a minor bit of work in _econf_save_data_to_disk -- it needs local
and global tags, etc.  I need to clean some of that up.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

internal API is cleaning up now.  I think I've figured out how to resolve my
problem

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sun Oct 31 20:01:43 PST 1999

cleaned up API some more, added local tags to saving, working on fat entries to
disk, realizing the need for a fsck() command, etc.  Things are still coming
along smoothly

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_econf_purge_data_from_disk() should kinda work now.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

disk.c is almost done now.  just a little more work needed

Mostly cleaning up some code here and there.  read over a lot of code
carefully.  Added comments here and there, too.

some more api changes - changed eConfigStoreData() and added
eConfigStoreDataToFirstAvailablePath().
