Things I need to do to this thang ::)

Feel free to add stuff to it. I am very happy to delete any lines other
people add =P

o Checkerboard bg [HIGH PRIORITY]
  I currently use a checkerboard bg for zooming out. This is very cool ::)
  But. I create one per window, at the same size as the image the window
  contains. This is not good. It uses memory, lots of. What I need to do is
  to create a small tile of that pattern, and tile it onto each image when
  needed.

o Progressive loading
  This will be very cool. Unfortunately, it will be tricky to implement for
  multiple windows, so I will have to rework my window creation functions,
  and it will be awkward to do without being able to attach data to the
  Imlib progress function.

o Setting the X background
  May as well...

o Index mode
  Currently very hard coded, needs more options, and more dynamism. I need
  to check font metrics and center the text, make sure it isn't too big,
  etc.

o Montage mode
  Need to do transparent blending for images with no alpha channel

o Menu.
  Need to create a right-click menu for doing stuff with. Maybe I'll steal
  the menu code from Eterm ;-)

o Slideshow mode
  Move to next image on timer. User-defined interval. (Pinch DoIn from e ;)
