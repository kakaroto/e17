Things I need to do to this thang ::)

Feel free to add stuff to it. I am very happy to delete any lines other
people add =P

o General

Rework zoom code to be more flexible/sane :-)
Scrollbars? Dunno.
Switch over to popt for option handling. This'll let me process
strings and do multiple parse runs etc without the current hacks I use. I'll
have to include a version of popt for lib-challenged folk. (worth it?)
