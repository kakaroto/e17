.SH NAME
feh - image viewer and cataloguer
.SH SYNOPSIS
feh [options] file(s)
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B feh
is an image viewer using the
.B imlib2
library to open and manipulate images.
.B feh
has a large number of operational modes. The default mode is an image
slideshow, showing one image at a time from those specified on the
commandline. Keys and mouse control may be used to move through them. Other
modes can be specified on the commandline, and are described below.
.PP
.B feh
can also recurse through a directory structure to form a filelist for
processing, and will convert directory names on the commandline into a list
of their contents automatically.
.PP
.B Filelists
can be sorted in a number of ways. The default is the order the files were
specified on the commandline, or the order they were read from the disk. You
can specify sorting modes such as
.B
randomize
or you can sort by filename, image name, width, height, pixels, etc.
.SH MODES
.B Montage mode
forms a montage from the filelist. The resultant image can be viewed or
saved, and it's size can be limited by height, width or both.
.PP
.B Index mode
forms an index print from the filelist. Image thumbnails are shown along
with the filename, filesize and pixel size, printed using a truetype font of
your choice. The resultant image can be viewed or saved, and it's size can
be limited by height, width or both.
.PP
.B Multiwindow mode
shows images in multiple windows, instead of as a slideshow in one window.
Don't use with a large filelist ;)
.PP
.B Fullscreen mode
shows image in fullscreen view, can be combined with a slide-change delay to
show an automated presentation.
.PP
.B List mode
doesn't display images. Outputs an 'ls'-style listing of the files in the
filelist, including image info such as size, pixels, type, etc.
.PP
.B feh
can also list either all the loadable files in a filelist or all the
unloadable files. Useful for preening a directory.
.PP
.B feh
also has the ability to load files over http or ftp, simply specify the url
on the commandline.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 5
.B -h, --help
display help output and exit
.TP 5
.B -v, --version
output version information and exit
.TP 5
.B -V, --verbose
output useful information, progress bars, etc
.TP 5
.B -q, --quiet
Don't report non-fatal errors for failed loads. Verbose and quiet modes
are not mutually exclusive, the first controls informational messages,
the second only errors.
.TP 5
.B -r, --recursive
Recursively expand any directories in FILE to the content of those
directories, all the way down to the bottom level. (Take it easy)
.TP 5
.B -c, --randomize
When viewing multiple files in a slideshow, randomise the file list before
displaying.
.TP 5
.B -p, --preload
Preload images. This doesn't mean hold them in RAM, it means run through
them and eliminate unloadable images first. Otherwise they will be removed
as you flick through. This also analyses the images to get data for use in
sorting, such as pixel size, type etc. A preload run will be automatically
performed if you specify one of these sort modes.
.TP 5
.B -F, --full-screen
Make the window fullscreen
.TP 5
.B -w, --multiwindow
Disable slideshow mode. With this setting, instead of opening multiple
files in slideshow mode, multiple windows will be opened, one per file.
.TP 5
.B -x, --borderless
Create borderless windows
.TP 5
.B -P, --noprogressive
Disable progressive loading and display of images
.TP 5
.B -d, --draw-filename
Draw the filename at the top-left of the image
.TP 5
.B -D, --slideshow-delay NUM
For slideshow mode, specifies time delay (seconds) between automatically
changing slides. Great for presentations.
.TP 5
.B -R, --reload NUM
Use this option to tell 
.B feh
to reload an image after NUM seconds. Useful for viewing webcams via http,
or even on your local machine.
.TP 5
.B -k, --keep-http
When viewing files using http, feh normally deletes the local copies after
viewing, or, if caching, on exit. This option prevents this so that you
get to keep the local copies. They will be in /tmp with "feh" in the name.
.TP 5
.B -l, --list
Don't display images. Analyse them and display an 'ls'-style listing.
Useful in scripts hunt out images of a certain size/resolution/type etc.
.TP 5
.B -U, --loadable
Don't display images. Just print out their names if imlib2 can successfully
load them.
.TP 5
.B -u, --unloadable
Don't display images. Just print out their name if imlib2 can NOT
successfully load them.
.TP 5
.B -S, --sort SORT_TYPE
The file list may be sorted according to image parameters. Allowed sort
types are: name, filename, width, height, pixels, size, format. For sort
modes other than name or filename, a preload run will be necessary,
causing a delay proportional to the number of images in the list
.TP 5
.B -X, --action ACTION
Specify a string as an action to perform when the enter key is pressed in
slideshow or multiwindow modes. The action will be executed in a shell.
Use these format specifiers to refer to image properties:
%f image path/filename
.br
%n image name
.br
%s image size (bytes)
.br
%p image pixel size
.br
%w image width
.br
%h image height
.br
%t image format
.br
Eg. feh -X "mv %f ~/images/%n" *
.br
In slideshow mode, the next image will be shown after running the action,
in multiwindow mode, the window will be closed.
.TP 5
.B -m, --montage
Enable montage mode. Montage mode creates a new image consisting of a grid
of thumbnails of the images in the filelist. When montage mode is selected,
certain other options become available. See MONTAGE MODE OPTIONS
.TP 5
.B -i, --index
Enable Index mode. Index mode is similar to montage mode, and accepts the
same options. It creates an index print of thumbails, printing user-defined
information beneath each thumbnail. Index mode enables certain other
options, see INDEX MODE OPTIONS
.TP 5
.B -B, --booth
Combines some options suitable for a nice booth display mode. A fullscreen
slideshow with a slide change every 20 seconds...
.SH MONTAGE MODE OPTIONS
.TP 5
.B -A, --ignoreaspect
By default, the montage thumbnails will retain their aspect ratios, while
fitting in --thumb-width and --thumb-height. This option will force them to
be the size set by --thumb-width and --thumb-height This will prevent any
whitespace in the final montage
.TP 5
.B -s, --stretch
Normally, if an image is smaller than the specified thumbnail size, it will
not be enlarged. If this option is set, the image will be scaled up to fit
the thumnail size. (Aspect ratio will be maintained unless --ignoreaspect is
specified)
.TP 5
.B -y, --thumb-width NUM
Set thumbnail width in pixels
.TP 5
.B -z, --thumb-height NUM
Set thumbnail height in pixels
Thumbnails default to 20x20 pixels
.TP 5
.B -W, --limit-width NUM
Limit the width of the montage in pixels
.TP 5
.B -H, --limit-height NUM
Limit the height of the montage in pixels These options can be used together
(to define the image size exactly), or separately. If only one is specified,
theother is calculated from the number of files specified and the size of
the thumbnails.  The default is to limit width to 800 pixels and calculate
the height as necessary
.TP 5
.B -b, --bg FILE
Use FILE as a background for your montage. With this option specified, the
size of the montage will default to the size of FILE if no size restrictions
are specified.
.TP 5
.B -o FILE
Save the created montage to FILE
.TP 5
.B -O FILE
Just save the created montage to FILE without displaying it (use in scripts)
.SH INDEX MODE OPTIONS
.TP 5
.B -f FONT
Use FONT to print the information under each thumbnail. FONT should be a
truetype font, resident in the current directory, or in feh's font
directory, and should be defined in the form fontname/size(points). (No
extension). eg. -f myfont/12
.TP 5
.B -T,--title-font FONT
Use FONT to print a title on the index, if no font is specified, a title
will not be printed
.SH SLIDESHOW KEYS

left to zoom out, click once to restore 1x zoom), and mouse button 3 closes
all open windows and ends the current session.
.SH SUGGESTED USAGE EXAMPLES
Here are some examples of nice option combinations to achieve cool results:
