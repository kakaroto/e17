This is the start of an e17 module to run engage nicely with real transpareny
in the sexiest window manager out there :)

To use it compile as before (you must have e17 installed when you run
./configure (or ./autogen.sh) then with e17 running type:

enlightenment_remote -module-load engage

then you should (from the e17 module menu) disable ibar and enable engage.

enjoy
