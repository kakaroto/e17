Erss is a RSS feed reader using EFL libs.

INSTALLATION:

./autogen.sh
make
make install

USAGE:
erss /usr/local/share/erss/config/osnews.cfg


NOTE:
If the slashdot.cfg is not working try HandyAndE's mirror (handyande.cfg).

For testing you can use the config files named radius.cfg.
(You risk getting banned if you hammer /. every 5th min for a period of time)

You can find lots of feeds here, just make config files for them:
