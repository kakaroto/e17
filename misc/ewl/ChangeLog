ChangeLog for EWL 0.2
=====================

-----
20000622-1223-PDT, pabs

Just a test of the new changelog script. dunno how i got so far behind
before. :)

-----
20000622-1224-PDT, pabs

okay updated the README and COPYING* files to be more accurate. Also,
we're now optionally licensed under the TVEL version 2 or higher in
addition to the BSD license.

-----
20000622-1328-PDT, pabs

- added ewl_ll_{push,push_with_data,pop,pop_data}(), which means that
all linked lists in ewl are implicitly stacks too.  Things like
containers can use this to create poppable containment (eg a layered
container might push a widget onto the bottom, then pop it off again).
- EwlContainer parent class should be almost completely functional now,
except for the default event propagator -- it doesnt' propagate mouse
movements and shit correclty.
- Updated AUTHORS, mvoed code to src/ (it was getting kinda messy in
here), created doc/ (nothing there yet tho).

-----
20000703-1146-PDT, pabs

Did a bit of a regression -- somewhere along the line I horribly broke
something.  Not sure what or where, but it segv'ed badly and backtraces
were useless.  I've been really busy at work and outside of work
(friends getting married, Diablo II release, etc), and I haven't had
much time to work on EWL.  That should change now.

-----
20000703-1453-PDT, pabs

- widgets can be grabbed and focused now with ewl_widget_grab(),
  ewl_widget_ungrab(), ewl_widget_focus(), and ewl_widget_unfocus(). 
  note that grabbing a widget focuses it, and that you cannot unfocus
  grabbed widgets until you ungrab them (this may change in the future
  if we make more of a distinction between keyboard and mouse focus in
  widgets).
- fixed stupid allocation bug.  you have to allocate EwlLayouts in 
  EwlWidgets before you can work with them. :)
- ewl_event_propagate() correctly checks to see fi widgets are containers
  (or a derivative type) by checkig the HAS_CHILDREN flag, and calling
  ewl_cotnainer_event_propagate() if it does.  If it doesn't, then the
  call is just passed to the widget itself.  Note that this means i need
  to rewrite the EwlWindow widget and overload the insert and remove 
  commands (eg so they only accept one child).

-----
20000703-1611-PDT, pabs

added ewl_widget_render() and ewl_widget_render_onto_parent() (the latter
calls the former).  here's the quetsion.  are these functions called from
the render callback (EwlWidget::render()), or do they check to see if the
callback exists and call it themself?  I think the former would be 
cleaner, but it would also be harder in the future.  Doing the latter
will allow widgets to render themselves into the EwlWidget::rendered 
var, hten ewl_widget_render_onto_parent will take care of the rest -- this
allows you to call ewl_widget_render() in the base expose callback, where
the other wouldn't.  So I think I'll go for the latter, and hope it 
works out correctly.  If it's wrong, we can always fix it later. :)


-----
20000703-1720-PDT, pabs

Added the documentation equivalent of hooks. :)  The layout is there, but
there's no content.  I decided to use HTML, because it's easy to write
and it's supported on every platform under the sun.  I'll try to be as
lynx friendly as possible.

-----
20000705-1240-PDT, pabs

the feh_imlib2 wrapper from feh has been ported to ewl.  Check the 
imlib.h and imlib.c files for the api.  It's pretty much a direct copy
and paste, but I cleaned up the code a wee bit, and consolidated some
duplicate shit.  The AUTHORS file has been appropriately credited..

-----
20000705-1548-PDT, pabs

Okay EwlImLayer and EwlImage rendering code is in place (called
via ewl_widget_render() in render.c).  It's pretty straightforward
code, and it calls the imlib routines that Tom hammered out in feh
(plus my rotation code), so I don't see why it would have any problems
other than bad information. Unfortunately there is no API for creating
ImageLayers ore the EwlImages themselves, so it's kinda hard to test
it for sure.  Anyways, I'll work on that and some registry + db
goodies to load images.  Any suggestions regarding db key syntax (a
standard of some sort) would be appreciated now.  I have a pretty
good idea how I want it to work (Boris' and I hashed this all out
aobut a month ago), but there might be crazy ideas out there that I
havne't heard).  Anyways, we will have a functional rendering and 
event api very soon.

-----
20000705-1650-PDT, pabs

moved EwlImLayer and EwlImage to image.[hc] files.  I don't want widget.c
ending up like state.c (eg uglier than giblet's mom).

-----
20000705-1853-PDT, pabs

More goodies from feh!  I decided it'd be good to have full error-
handling for the ewl imlib wrapper.  Well, what do you know --  feh 
already has error strings for all the Imlib2 error codes.  I think
I'll just steal those too. :)  Thanks again Tom -- check out 
ewl_imlib_get_error_string() in imlib.c for more of your hard work. :)


-----
20000705-2131-PDT, pabs

Finished API for EwlImage and EwlImLayer.  

-----
20000705-2144-PDT, pabs

added ewl_widget_imlayer_insert/remove/push/pop() to widget.c.  This
is a very good thing -- technically we can render right now
(unfortunately you'd have to set up all the images and image layers by
hand -- not fun).

-----
20000710-1926-PDT, pabs

- added an EwlBool wrapper and replaced all the char shit in ewl_ll with
it.  this should be much cleaner looking now.  for those of you who
dont' know, but do read the changelogs, you _have_ to return true for
ewl_ll_foreach callbacks in order for it to continue.  this is a feature,
not a bug -- since it let's you drop out of foreach callbacks without
resorting to ugly global variable hacks.  I know this is going to be
a problem in the future, so i'm just explaining why right now.  

-----
20000710-2041-PDT, pabs

- started on EwlButton class -- you realize how much shit you need
when you start thigns like that.
- added ew_container_get/set_max_children() -- THIS ADDS AN ADDITIONAL
O(n) (where N is the size of the ll) TO YOUR INSERT TIME -- please
dont' harass me about it -- i commented the friggin header twice.  The
reason is that there's a ewl_ll_sizeof(container->children) call to
check the size of hte linked list.  this is the only way to do it
without l33t h4x0ring in the ll implementation (eg iterating over the
entire linked list on every insertion with one op per node).  And
that would break a lot of shit without any real benefit.
- added propagate_events flag to EwlContainer -- so you can create
composite widgets easily by just disabling event propagation (eg
mousemoves and clicks) and attaching callbacks to the container itself.

-----
20000710-2135-PDT, pabs

- ewl_button appeasr to be complete. (except for the widget db themming
stuff, but i'll add that later).  can't add buttons without some sort
of container though......

-----
20000710-2201-PDT, pabs

okay EwlButton compiles clean -- added it ot the makefile (note that
thsi doesn't mean that it actually _works_ correctly ,but it's a
good indictaion).  EwlButton will probably be the sample widget that
I document for widget authors.  The general setup is as follows:

ewl_widgettype_new_*() :  allocate widget, call widgettype_init_*()
ewl_widgettype_init()  : initialize parent class,
                         sanitize data,
                         load theme db (registry) shit (not implemented)
                         connect widgettype callbacks
                         misc config (eg user specified stuff)
ewl_widgettye_set/get_flag() : get set widget-specific flags

ewl_widgettype_dosomething() : misc widget-specific stuff

all of this is demonstarted in ewlbutton.h and ewlbutton.c (though
not commented very well -- yet).

-----
20000711-0204-PDT, pabs

- added EwlLabel (ewllabel.h and ewllabel.c) -- a basic text label
with font and direction support.  this reminds me that i need to 
add some font-path stuff to the state struct.  Wow, more code in
state.c.. great.
- the db stuff is high priority now, all the widgets need to be
fixed to support the media loading stuff once the registry is
complete -- particularly ewlbutton and ewllabel, but also things
like loading hte default fant path, and the prefix for media.

-----
20000711-0228-PDT, pabs

- finished up EwlLabel API -- compiles clean, added to Makefile, 
linked in main.  this means it seems to work, but i won't know
until i get a box to try it out (tomorrow).
- moved ewl.h to ewlcore.h, and created a new ewl.h for applications
to include  (which includes ewlcore.h, ewlcontainer, ewlbutton etc).
- added ewllabel.h to ewl.h
- i forgot to emtion this earlier: composite widget types should
subclass EwlContainer and use the ewl_container_set_propagate_events
to FALSE -- it won't automatically attempt to propagate events to
children (or you could just override the propagate handler, but
this is a bit easier for certain implementations).
- if peopleare looking for ways to help, you could try and digest
teh changelog entries and code and start working on some documentation.
there are documentation hooks in the doc/ folder.  rigth now it's
jsut html, and i'd kinda like to keep it that way.  nothing against
dox2 (actually i haven't even looked at it yet), but html is
supported everywhere and imo is great for things like programmers
references.
- uim' going to sleep -- i have work in less than 7 hours.,

-----
20000711-1820-PDT, pabs

- ported EwlWindwo to be a subclass of EwlCtonaienr with max_children
set to one.
- added padding to EWlWidget, along with ewl_widget_set/get_padding().
- padding is rendered in ewl_widget_render_onto_parent(), by offsetting
the X and Y rendering location on the parent.  CONTAINER WIDGETS ARE
REQUIRED TO COMPENSATE FOR WIDGET PADDING.  when you set a widget's
size, it does not include the padding.  I had to make a decision
between including the padding in the size, or counting it as extra
padding -- i chose the latter.  note that it's set to 0 by default, 
so widget subclasses or app developers have to specifically set it
to something else before it'll cause problems.  you can also jsut
ignore it completely and use padding in your theme images instead --
this might be mor eappropriate in some situations.
- moved the call to ew_widget_add() -- eg add the widget to the state
widget list -- from the individual widget init funcs to the default
ewl_widget_init() (actually i did this last night, but forgot to
mention it in the changelog).  It _has_ to be done, or wierd things
will happen (not right now, but in the future), and it doesnt' really
matter if it's handled by the widget author or the lib, so it might as
well be the lib.

-----
20000711-1854-PDT, pabs

- added ewl_widget_set/get_type() and made sure it was in all the 
widgettype_init() funcs, right afte rhte parent class initialzer.

-----
20000711-2206-PDT, pabs

- added ewl_container_render_children() for EwlContainers.  This is
called by ewl_widget_render() if a widget a) has not overloaded its
widget->render() callback, and b) if the widget is marked as a 
container (eg the HAS_CHIDREN flag is set).
- added preliminary EWlBox widget (ewlbox.h and ewlbox.c)

-----
20000714-1955-PDT, pabs

default insert and remove handlers for ewlcontainers now generate
an EWL_EVENT_RESIZE if the child is visible.  (a show should propagate
a resize all the way back up to the toplevel, so it's not necessary
unless it's visible).

-----
20000715-0118-PDT, pabs

completed ewlbox.h and ewlbox.c -- compile clean.  teh new test
core dumps right now, but i'm sure i'll get it figured out soon.

-----
20000716-0055-PDT, pabs

- added ewl_event_get_type(), ewl_event_get_type_string() and 
ewl_widget_get_type_string() for debugging.  still can't figure out
what the hell is causing the segfault, but I think it might be
somewhere in the ewlcontainer code -- if i don't pack any widgets
into the toplevel window ,the test app runs fine.


-----
20000717-1202-PDT, pabs

- still coredumping -- added a bunch of debugging output so richlowe
and I can  peek trhough hte code and find the culprit.
- NULLs and 0s out the new elements of EwlEvents when allocted with
ewl_event_new_by_type()

-----
20000717-1351-PDT, pabs

- Found the culprit -- event propagation for EwlContainers was looking at
a bogus widget.  Event propagatoin is temporarily disabled until i get
a chance to fix it.

-----
20000717-1622-PDT, pabs

- I conveniently blew away the fixes I made from an hour ago, so here
they are again.  fiexed small warnings (implicit defintion of snprintf,
and some other small stuff).

-----
20000719-1248-PDT, pabs

- added ewl_image_load/save() -- save doesn't apply changed attributes to
the image, but it will soon (eg changed width, height, angle etc). That's
a TODO though.

-----
20000719-1643-PDT, pabs

- added ewl_state_set/get_theme() and ewl_state_set/get_application_name().
the theme parser will use this to get the appropriate files for theme
entries.  basically it'll be in the following order:
~/.ewl/personal/applicationName-widgetType.db
~/.ewl/personal/widgetType.db
~/.ewl/themes/themeName/applicationName-widgetType.db
~/.ewl/themes/themeName/widgetType.db
PREFIX/share/ewl/themes/themeName/applicationName-widgetType.db
PREFIX/share/ewl/themes/themeName/widgetType.db
PREFIX/share/ewl/default/applicationName-widgetType.db
PREFIX/share/ewl/default/widgetType.db

so basically, you're application named gibletApp does an
ewl_registry_load_imlayer("/EwlButton/layers") or whatever (the
syntax isn't quite worked out yet), and the theme engine will look 
for a ~/.ewl/personal/gibletApp-EwlButton.db and get the appropriate
data.  I eventually plan on having an ewl_registry_load_widget_media()
or somethign similar, that'll set all the widget values to default. :)

-----
20000720-1356-PDT, pabs

- added e_check_bool_strnig() to util.h.  basically it returns TRUE if a 
string is "yes", "active", "true", or "1" (case insensitive).  things 
are a bit slower loading, but much easier to read in the long run.
- added src/create_personal_preferences.sh -- you HAVE to run this or
the ewltest program (and all ewl programs after that) will SEGV.  Sorry,
we have to start somewhere -- I might make it generate an
~/.ewl/prefernces if it doesn'te xist, but that's in the future.
- ewl_state_init() now reads it's default settings from your user
preferences file.  this currently includes the theme db loading path,
antialiasing rendering, dithering rendering, and active theme.  Sooner
or later I'm going to have to document all this. :)

-----
20000721-1221-PDT, pabs

DAMN THAT WAS STUPID.  :)  The db library automatically strips the .db
suffix off of db files so the ndbm library doesn't get all pissed off.
unfortunately, I wasn't using the strip munction when i opened a db 
with write access.  dumb dumb dumb. needless to say, it's been fixed
now.

-----
20000721-1307-PDT, pabs

- moved theme.[hc] to registry.[hc] -- some of the older registry stuff
has changed in state.c as well. the name will eventually be changed to
theme.h again, but this is just to test and see if ieverything works.

-----
20000721-1351-PDT, pabs

- added an INSTALL file, that explains how to create the personal
preferences database.

-----
20000721-1717-PDT, pabs

memory corruption somewhere in ewl_registry_find_db() or hte linked list
callback associated with it (_cb_ewl_registry_find_db()).  i'm not sure
quite where it is yet, but i do know for sure that the functions it's
calling (eg the ll and db calls) are all sound memory-wise, so it has to
be something in there thats' whack.  Still no internet access at home
(fucking @home).

-----
20000724-1534-PDT, pabs

- found hte memory corruption problem -- missing a e_string_dup() in 
ewl_db_get() in db.c, also one in ewl_state_init() in state.c.  giblet
is responsible for the second one -- thanks giblet!
- seems to be a problem with ewl_ll_dup() -- it only copies the first
node.

-----
20000726-1154-PDT, pabs

- okay fuck it. for right now ewl_state_get_path_list() will return the
internal list.  so don't free it or you'll cause massive problems.  this
will change in the future -- i don't like returning itnernal data 
structures unless it's clear that hte function is going to do so.
- moved registry.[hc] to theme.[hc].

-----
20000726-1419-PDT, pabs

- finally, the stupid theme db finder works correctly.  the code is a
bit messy right now, but I'll clean it up later.  this leaves the loading
funcs themselves (which should, in theory, be cake), then rendering. :) 

-----
20000726-1645-PDT, pabs

- fixed makefile to reference headers instead of object files -- this
should significantly decrease compile time and keep the man off my back.

-----
20000726-1646-PDT, pabs

src/create_user_preferences.sh now creates the following:
  ~/.ewl/personal
  ~/.ewl/themes/
  ~/.ewl/themes/defaultTheme
  ~/.ewl/themes/defaultTheme/EwlWidget.db

the only settings in the EwlWidget db are padding, but it's a start.

-----
20000727-1849-PDT, pabs

- ewl_theme_get_string() works like it should -- eg you pass in a
theme string in the follwoing format: "/EwlWidgetType/default/path",
and it'll call ewl_theme_find_db(), find the correct database (see
above for resolution order), then return the key.  right now it 
just opens the db, grabs the data then closes the db, but I'll 
implement some sort of db caching in the state widget (eg it leaves
the db open), in th efuture.

-----
20000728-0009-PDT, pabs

- added new feature to ewldbtool that alters the syntax slightly --
now you can ahve ewldbtool save entries as floats or ints by using
the following syntax:

  ewldbtool dbfile key <type> value 
  where type is either "string", "int" or "integer", or "float"
  (case insensitive)

note that ewldbtool cannot currently read these entries.  I'm 
thinking about using only strings -- it's not much of a tradeoff
speed-wise, and it'd make it much easier to read and write these
things.


-----
20000728-0046-PDT, pabs

- accidentally blew away ewldbtool.c, so i had to rewrite the features
from 10 mins ago (see the changelog post above).
- wrote ewl_theme_get_int() and ewl_theme_get_float() -- note these
look for _strings_ to convert, not binary data.  I know it's slower,
but it's also much easy for third parties to work with.

-----
20000728-1130-PDT, pabs

- fixed a SEGV in ewl_theme_get_string().

-----
20000728-1207-PDT, pabs

- added ewl_container_set/get_child_padding().  this sets the global 
padding for a container.
- EwlContainers now have theme support as well (for child padding).
- added default EwlContainer theme (with padding set to zero) to 
  create_personal_preferences.sh.

-----
20000728-1317-PDT, pabs

- added ewl_theme_find_file() for finding media in the given search
path (defined in ~/.ewl/preferences.db).
- create_personal_preferences.sh now cps the themes/defaultTheme
directory to ~/.ewl/themes.  This is mainly for testing the new
ewl_theme_find_file() routines (which seem to work okay so far, but
i want to be sure).  This means you can technically override images
too.  Oh, here's the media search order (again, it uses the theme
search path defined in your preferences.db file):

~/.ewl/personal/theme/mediaPath
~/.ewl/personal/mediaPath
~/.ewl/themes/theme/mediaPath
~/.ewl/themes/mediaPath
/usr/local/share/ewl/themes/theme/mediaPath
/usr/local/share/ewl/themes/mediaPath
/usr/local/share/ewl/mediaPath
/usr/local/share/ewl/default/theme/mediaPath
/usr/local/share/ewl/default/mediaPath

and dbs are similar, but a bit more complicated (since you can 
override dbs on an application-by-application basis). see farther
above for a rough overview of how theme dbs are serached for.

-----
20000728-1526-PDT, pabs

- added ewl_theme_get_imlayer().  Here's a rough description of the
db string format:

ewl_theme_get_imlayer("/EwlButton/layer-01") will look for the following:
  - "/EwlButton/layer-01/name"   : imlayer name
  - "/EwlButton/layer-01/width"  : default height
  - "/EwlButton/layer-01/height" : default width
  - "/EwlButton/layer-01/alpha"  : render alpha channel (bool)
  - "/EwlButton/num_images"      : number of images
  - "/EwlButton/image-01"        : first image

-----
20000728-1632-PDT, pabs

- added ewl_widget_get_theme(wid,key) to theme.c -- this loads an
EwlWidget's name, padding, and imlayers. added it to the to the 
widgettype_init() funcations.
- EwlContainer child padding renamed to child_padding in theme (to
avoid conflicting with default widget padding).
- added ewl_widget_get_theme(type) to init funcs for EwlWidget,
EwlContainer, EwlBox (also EwlHBox, EwlVBox, and EwlLBox), EwlWindow,
EwlButton, and EwlLabel -- which means all of htese widget types are
now themable.
- damn this is getting smooth.  Okay, on to rendering.

-----
20000728-2200-PDT, pabs

- cleaned up debugging output in theme.c -- now it only dumps crap
on the screen when debugging is enabled.  unless it can't find a theme
file for a particular widget, then it'll still dump shit all over
the screen.

-----
20000728-2232-PDT, pabs

- added ewl_widget_set_needs_refresh/resize() to widget.c.
- ewl_widget_set_needs_refresh flags the widget if it is visible and
hasn't already been flagged, then propagates the flag upwards unless
the DONT_PROPAGATE_REFRESH flag is set.  if the widget is a toplevel
window, it queues an EXPOSE event.  toplevel windows are responsible
for calling ewl_widget_render() on themselves (which recurses
through their children as well), then rendering the final
w->rendered onto an X Drawable.  All this should be done in the
EXPOSE callback.
- ewl_widget_set_needs_resize flags the widget if it is visible, can
resize (via the CAN_RESIZE flag), and hasn't already been flagged,
then propagates the flag upwards unless the DONT_PROPAGATE_RESIZE flag
is set.  if the widget is a toplevel window, it queues a CONFIGURE
event.  toplevel windows are responsible for calling
ewl_widget_render() on themselves (which recurses trhough their
children as well), then rendering the final w->rendered onto a 
reallocated X Drawable.  All this should be done in the CONFIGURE
callback.


-----
20000728-2354-PDT, pabs

- okay rendering is officially in the code now.  see the callback
handler in ewlwindow.c -- specifically the EWL_EVENT_EXPOSE and
EWL_EVENT_CONFIGURE case switches.

IT SEGVs RIGHT NOW -- HOPEFULLY GIBLET AND RICHLOWE WILL H4X0R THIS
TOMORROW WITH ME. :)  (not sober atm)



-----
20000731-0205-PDT, pabs

- okay i guess the X calls don't SEGV after all.  still does't display
the widgets yet, but it's a start.
- got some useful input from raster today -- i'm going to implement
three of the four things he mentioned tomorrow.  i'm still not sure
that representing complex (eg combinations of smaller events, known
as signals in GTK+) as string constants is such a hot idea though.
i'd like to discuss that one a bit more.  anywyas, the fixes for
the imlib2 wrapper wil be in tomorrow.  And I forgot to have the
ewlbutton be a container -- silly me. :)

-----
20000731-2242-PDT, pabs

- got it -- finally.  I guess imlib gets really cranky when it doesn't
know what display, visual, or colormap it's using. :P  I'll add a
func to set teh context before rendering.

-----
20000731-2325-PDT, pabs

- imlayers contain images, not padding. fixed :)
- imlayers should sanitize their ll parent, otherwise the renderer
  tries to dereference a pointer into nada land. :/

-----
20000801-1053-PDT, pabs

- removed the extra imload from the EwlWindow event handler -- this
should speed things up a little bit.  
- rendering is slow right now -- i need to optimize the EXPOSE 
handler -- I'll work on that today.

-----
20000801-1256-PDT, pabs

- added debugging to most ewl_imlib routines.
- EwlWindows now check the count of an EXPOSE event before rendering.

-----
20000801-1925-PDT, pabs

- added ewl_widget_imlayer_foreach() -- does what the name says, runs a
callback on every imlayer.  Useful for showing or hiding large groups
of imlayers.
- ewlwindows now show all their image layers by default -- I may move
this to the ewl_theme_load_imlayer() func though (add a "visible"
option).
- added a "visible" option to EwlImage and EwlImLayer themes.
- changed EwlRRect initializer to set the bottom relative X and Y to
the max (8192).  I think relative positioning will take precedence
over regular positioning -- anyone have anything to say about this?
- Expose events now free their expose rect if it's been allcoated.
- mmoved the imlib calls in the EwlWindow expose handler to 
ewl_window_set_render_context().  Maybe this should be a push/pop
operation instead?
- cleanup to the theme.c imlayer and image laoding code.
- fixed the naming bug in ewl_theme_get_imlayer() -- images will load now.
- fixed ewl_theme_get_image() thought the key of images was their path --
whops. fixed now :)
- widget layer loading works now.

- the following two strings are now valid keys for image paths:
  "/EwlWindow/layer-00/image-00"
  "/EwlWindow/layer-00/image-00/path"
(if the first one doesn't work, ewl will try the second one)
- added ewl_container_resize_children() and EwlContainer::resize_children()
if EwlContainer::resize_children() isn't defined, the default handler
sets all the widgets to the size of the container, minus the appropriate
child padding.  This is useful for containesr with only one child, since
they don't need to override the initial resize_children() handler to
get the appropriate behavior.
- ewl_container_resize() now sets the NEEDS_REFRESH flag and unsets the
NEEDS_RESIZE flag.

- removed EwlWidget->child (no need any more with the EwlContainer 
stuff).
- still have the damn segv in the mousemove propagation handler.
- aha.. got the SEGV -- i mixed up the callbac_find() return value --
it was returning FALSE for the found widget and TRUE for the not-
found ones. :)

-----
20000804-1143-PDT, pabs

- for somereason ewl doens't seem to like the CAN_RESIZE flag.
Commented out of the ewlcontainer propagation code until I can
figure out why.
- renamed and rewrote _cb_find_ewhe to _cb_ewl_find_event_handler(),
and I used a couple of temp vars to make it more legible, but the
damn thing still crashes.
- changed EwlData to be a void cast instead of an unsigned char.


-----
20000804-1306-PDT, pabs

- looks like giblet and I tied on finding the memory corruption in
the event propagation.  boy and I dumb. :)  ewl_ll_callback_find()
returns an EwlLL, ***not*** and EwlWidget. :)
- okay event propagation seems to work now, but I'll have to tweak
around with it a bit just to be sure.
- forgot to wrap imlib_create_cropped_scaled_image() in imlib.c with
the NULL checks.  fixed now.

-----
20000804-1700-PDT, pabs

- EwlWindows now get their own paddign.
- layout is still b0rked in a few places.
- EwlButton doesn't seem to render rigth now.  hmmmmm.

-----
20000805-1840-PDT, pabs

- officially in cvs now, thx to giblet.
- updated TODO and a few other files.
- santitize child_padding[] for EwlContainers
- wahoo that fixed the padding problem.

-----
20000805-2140-PDT, pabs

- fixed the rendering problem -- widgets without backgrounds get a
transparent one. :)

-----
20000818-1612-EDT, x5rings

Added window property code to set values and hints etc before window creation.
See main.c for example. =)

-----
20000818-1653-PDT, pabs

- added EwlWindow helper funcs ewl_window_move/resize_moveresize/get_rect()
- windows should still map themselves in the SHOW callback, not in the
  realize handler -- shame shame x5rings. :P
- moved rect-related code for EwlWindows to EWlWidget::layout->rect.
- added ewl_widget_move/resize/moveresize/set_rect/get_rect().  the
  calls above fore ewlwidnows are just wrappers for these calls, which
  are all wrappers for the set_rect() call. :)
- misc cleanups to the ewlwindow.h
- mysterious resize bug has just cropped up -- iv'e commented out the
  code in the new ewl_window_*() funcs, so it' somewhere else.

The bug mentioned above will attempt to create and map a 65kx65k 
window -- X will get pissed off and probably crash.  In other words,
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DON'T RUN THIS UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
We'll let y'all know when it's fixed (probalby sometime tonight or
tomorrow).

-----
20000818-1915-PDT, pabs

- moved all X calls in ewl_window_init() to ewl_widnow_realize()
- on a side note, i think I hate autoconf and automake -- no real
benefit on _my_ side of things, and it slows down the compile and
generates crappy bloated makefiles.  plus it's harder for me to
configure 'em (i'm a pure Makefile man myself).

-----
20000818-2052-PDT, pabs

- got it.. passing a 32-bit integer to a func expecting a 16-bit one
is always a bad idea.  it's an especially bad idea when the fucntion
in question creates X drawables.

/me points at ewl_window_realize()
/me slaps x5rings on the wrist.

-----
20000818-2119-PDT, pabs

misc cleanups.  fixed the ewlwindow.h header (whoops!).

-----
20000818-2301-PDT, pabs

- add a EWL_EVENT_RESIZE hook for EWlWindwos -- they __should__ resize
automatically on resize events now, but they don't -- something is
really fucked up here.
- showing and hiding widgets now queues a resize on them ala gtk+
(well, techincally gtk+ queues a resize on the parent, but we 
already do soemthign similar with the upward-propagating NEEDS_RESIZE
flag).
- misc cleanups to main.c (callbacks should be EWlBool, not char :P).
- sanity checks on the value passed to XResizeWindow().. whoops. :)

-----
20000819-0111-PDT, pabs

- got the resize bug. turns out you couldn't resize the widgets
(which i would have seen hours ago had i turned debugging on).
- okay so  now the resize shit works, and hte resize shit in the
button callback works, but only if you resize the window once.
I'll tackle this one tomorrow. 

-----
20000819-0219-PDT, pabs

- clenaed up state.h -- added helper funcs (see below), ordered
functions in a more logical order,  labeled everything so 
coders can grok 'em easily, and moved the internal functions to
a section marked private. cleaned up state.c a little bit (just 
for you richlowe).
- added wrapper functions forstate calls.  hers' a list:
    ewl_set_application_name()
    ewl_get_application_name()
    ewl_set_theme()
    ewl_get_theme()
    ewl_insert_path()
    ewl_remove_path()
    ewl_get_path_list()
    ewl_get_path_strings()
    ewl_render_antialiased_set()
    ewl_render_dithered_set()
    ewl_render_antialiased_get()
    ewl_render_dithered_get()
    ewlg_set_display()
    ewlg_get_display()


-----
20000819-0241-PDT, pabs

- updated entire tree to reflect cleaner state api.

-----
20000819-1045-PDT, pabs

- ewl_widget_set_rect() now emits a EWL_EVENT_MOVE on the widget if
the x or y is adjusted.
- aded ewl_event_new_by_type_with_widget().  To emit an simple event
(eg one that doesn't have any additional parameters that need to be
set), you can just do the following:
    ev = ewl_event_new_by_type_with_widget(EWL_EVENT_HAXOR, widget);
    ewl_event_queue(ev);



-----
20000819-1049-PDT, pabs

- added EWL_EVENT_MOVE hook to EWlWindows -- you _should_ be able
to move them around now with override-redirect on, but I ahven't
checked yet.
- didn't work.. dont' know why yet.
- whoops!  forgot to actually connect EwlWindows to the event
handler. hehe. :)
- okay it works in my sample mouseup handler, ubt not before the
window is mapped. hmm.
- okay works now, but it's not being exposed if it's clipped on
the screen boundaries. hmm

-----
20000819-1518-PDT, pabs

- expose events only need to refresh the region in question, not the
entire window.  this is a noticable speed improvement.
- chnaged the default antialiasing to off.. hope that'sokay

-----
20000819-1539-PDT, pabs

- added x5rings to AUTHORS file.
