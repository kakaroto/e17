There are two versions now.  The ewl version will install as 'empower_ewl'.
The etk version will install as 'empower_etk'.  If you only build one version,
it will be just called empower.  See below for how to control the building of
each version.

To install empower:
	./autogen.sh
	make
	make install (as root)
	
To enable/disable ewl/etk:
By default, this will be determined based on which toolkits are installed.
To override pass one or more of the following to ./autogen.sh:
	--enable-etk/--disable-etk     Enable/Disable ETK
	--enable-ewl/--disable-ewl     Enable/Disable EWL
	
Note:
Recently the etk version has been disabled by default due to compilation errors.
