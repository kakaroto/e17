This is a list of things we need to fix:

* More comprehensive Open With dialog.
* Multicolumn list view
* Better visual indication of directory sorting order
* More icon set sizes
* extractor plugin - fix odd behaviour (sliding window) and make the window
  move with the main entropy window if the latter is moved. how do we handle
  fullscreen mode or when there's no space to show the sliding window?
* copy / paste - menu based copy / paste. this will also require some work on
  etk's dnd  

This is a rough list of things we could implement:

[-] * more thumbnailers - pdf (done), ttf, text (makes more snese in icon view)
[-] * archives - ability to extract archives to a path
[-] * right click drag menus - when we drag with the right click, it would be
      nice to display a context menu (might need etk work)
[C] * icon mode for etk - implement icon view as soon as the etk iconbox arrives
[-] * status bar - make the statusbar meaningful (number of selected files, size
      etc...) especially in the upcoming icon mode
[-] * desktop support - icons on the desktop, backgrounds, etc.
[I] * directory / file properties - full properties dialog with perms, mime
      types, and any other info we wanna see in there.
[-] * directory summaries - directories could reflect what they have by
      displaying an emblem on their icon. the emblem could reflect the fact they
      are image folders, music folders, video folders etc... we can also
      associate applcations with them right there and then.
[-] * internal scripting - some sort of internal scripting language that would
      allow us to write minor scripts like: download from cam, copy to backup, etc.
[-] * about dialog - nice fat about dialog
[-] * ETK Rename dialog



Key:
[-] - not started
[I] - in progress
[C] - complete
