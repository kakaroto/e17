To understand how to interact with Edje or any other Evas based object we need
to review the basics of how the main loop manager handles events. Ecore 
maintains a list of pointers to functions to be called when a signal of a given
type is received. These functions are known as signal "handlers".

By default, Ecore awareness is limited to system singals like HUP or KILL. 
Additional libraries or modules like Ecore_Evas register new signal types for 
the event loop to be aware of. In the specific case of Evas the new signal 
types deal with the interaction between the user and the Evas objects displayed
in the canvas.

The developer can manipulate the list of handlers as well as creating new 
signal types. The latter among other subjects like timers and pollers exceed 
the scope of this book and are properly documented by the API reference and the
EFL Cookbook.
          
We will begin by setting up a simple signal handler that will be called any 
time the application is closed::

    Ecore_Event_Handler* close = NULL;
    ...
    int
    good_bye(void *data, int type, void *event)
    {
        //Removing handler for no reason other than API showoff
        if (ecore_event_handler_del(close))
            printf("Handler deleted\n");
              
        printf("Good bye! \n");
        ecore_main_loop_quit();
        ecore_evas_shutdown();
        ecore_shutdown();
        edje_shutdown();
    }
    ...
    int main() {
    ...
        close = ecore_event_handler_add(ECORE_EVENT_SIGNAL_EXIT,
                                        good_bye,"data");
        ...
        ecore_main_loop_begin();
        ...

This example moves the library shutdown procedure from the main function to the
"good_bye" function. Then before the main loop is initiated we add the handler 
for this signal type. The last parameter it's a pointer to any kind of data you
want to pass to the handler function, in this case is just a string containing 
"data".

Interaction with the interface works in a similar way. The Edje library 
registers its own handler function in the Ecore loop. This handler will be 
called for every signal coming from the interface. Therefore, in order to react
to interface events we need to register our functions as "callbacks" in this 
handler's list::

    ...
    void
    colorize(void *data, Evas_Object *o, const char *emission,
             const char *source)
    {
        Evas_Coord x,y;
        evas_pointer_canvas_xy_get(evas,&amp;x,&amp;y);
        if(x > 255) x = 255;
        if(y > 255) y = 255;             //R,   G,   B,   A,
        edje_color_class_set("main color", 190, x,   y,   255,
                                           255, 255, 255, 255,
                                           255, 255, 255, 255);
    }
    ...
    int main() {
        ...
        edje_object_signal_callback_add(edje, "mouse,move", "*",
                                        colorize,"data");
        ...
        ecore_main_loop_begin();
        ...

The resulting application changes the color of every part using the "main 
color" color class every time the mouse moves inside the interface. If you use 
the EDC theme included in the assembled example the result will be a small 
rectangle in the middle of the canvas that changes of color as we move our 
mouse around.

The function that produces this effect is our handler, or callback, ``colorize``. 
We call functions from the Evas API ``evas_pointer_canvas_xy_get`` and the Edje
API ``edje_color_class_set``. The first call gets the current coordinates of 
the mouse pointer position. The second call uses those values to alter the 
color class "main color".

Before the main loop begins we use ``edje_object_signal_callback_add`` to 
register our callback. The real handler keeps its own list of functions to call.
This list's index is a combination of the signal identification and the name of
the source that emitted it. In this particular case, the function ``colorize``
will be called when the signal "mouse,move" is emitted by any object in the
interface. Edje string matching supports wildcards for both the name and source
of the signal.
