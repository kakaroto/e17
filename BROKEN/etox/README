Etox - An evas based text layout library
----------------------------------------

Etox provides facilities for multi-line text layout, as well as obstacle
wrapping and text stylization.

Todo:
+ etox_free
+ obstacle wrapping
+ region selection
+ columnar layout
+ wrapping at word breaks
+ keep wrap marker with first text on line
+ add some checks to prevent problems when wrapping to extremely small areas

Progress:
+ Obstacle wrapping has the basic idea working, but needs improvement, it
  currently places the obstacle on a line in the correct place, but fails to
  rewrap around the obstacle correctly on window resize.
+ Also need to write generalized code to wrap/rewrap the lines when bit
  splitting has occurred.

Optimizations
-------------
+ REDUCE LIST TRAVERSING
