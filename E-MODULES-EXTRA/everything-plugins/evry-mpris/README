evry-mpris plugin is a frontend for mediaplayers that support mpris.

supported players/daemons:
- Amarok, Audacious, Exaile, Totem...
- corn, simple sound server. 
  http://incise.org/corn.html
- vlc works not so good (slow track change)


- xmms2, via xmms2-mpris-bridge (RECOMMENDED)

   install python bindings for xmmsclient, dbus and gobject, then
   cp xmms2-mpris-bridge/xmms2-mpris-bridge ~/.config/xmms2/startup.d

   any xmms2 client that starts the server also loads the bridge 
   automatically with this.


A cli remote can be found in mpris-remote. To easily add tracks or 
directories from a file manager (or everything) do:
cp mpris-remote/mpris-remote /usr/local/bin
cp mpris-remote/Add_Tracks.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/
