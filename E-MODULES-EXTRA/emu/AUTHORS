Some of this code was stolen from elsewhere in the E17 project.  In the
case of anything stolen from raster, it was stolen with permission.

The actual person to blame for emu is -

onefang (David Seikel) <onefang@gmail.com>

kingrayray (Ray MIller) created the blue emu image specifically to
donate to this module.  Thanks kingrayray.

more of the following people wrote the start module -
