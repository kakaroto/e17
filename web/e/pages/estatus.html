<p class="contenttitle">State of the E-nion</p>

<p>This "mini-document" is intended for reference for people wanting to be
involved in Enlightenment development for 0.17.0 and beyond. Please read ALL
of this before leaping to conclusions. Any part is subject to review and can
be changed. There is no priority implied here by the order of items.</p>

LibAST:
</td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newsbody">
Although this has historically been a miscellaneous/random
utility library, I'm taking steps to improve its usability.
Specifically, I'm in the process of documenting the entire API using
Doxygen to make it easier for other developers to make use of what it
offers. I'm also planning to work on cleaning up some of the
namespace issues.<br></br><br></br>
LibAST currently implements a fairly complete Object model, including
inheritence, polymorphism, interface classes, and more. This object
model will be used heavily in future Eterm development to simplify
compile- and run-time capability customization. The interface
mechanism will be especially useful for making pluggable rendering,
screen data storage, and configuration engines.
</td></tr></table>

<p><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newstitle">
Eterm
</td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newsbody">
The 0.9.x branch of Eterm development is essentially in bugfix
mode. I will continue maintenance and periodic release of this
codebase while 0.10 development proceeds.<br></br><br></br>
The 0.10 branch is where all the fun stuff will be happening. That
said, non-developers should beware of using it, since part of the
development process will involve ripping out large portions of code
and reimplementing them in a more OO fashion, which of course means
things will break. Hopefully, however, the end result will be one of
the most powerful and feature-rich terminal emulators in existence.
</td></tr></table>

<p><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newstitle">
Evas
</td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newsbody">
Evas is very much close to being feature-complete. It may have the largest
todo list of any project, but most features are post 1.0. Only a few things
remain to be done for a 1.0. It has been heavily tested for bugs, crashes,
leaks etc. It has partial documentation that needs completion. This is one
of the most mature parts of E right now. It's also one of the most exciting
as it has uses well beyond E itself, and will make development of E and 
associated tools child's play in future.
</td></tr></table>

<p><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newstitle">
Eet
</td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newsbody">
This library is night-complete. It's small and simple, but very useful. It
has very little left to be done - just full documentation and a more
expansive data type sterilizer that handles a few more data types. As it
stands it is fully usable, stable and ready to go where applicable.
</td></tr></table>

<p><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newstitle">
Edb
</td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newsbody">
This library is basically complete. Similar to eet but for a different
purpose it is for random access read AND WRITE access to files. Eet is
intended for really fast read, but write-once functionality, making for
much smaller files. Each library has its uses. They can be used together too.
</td></tr></table>

<p><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newstitle">
Ecore
</td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newsbody">
Now being worked on in the SPLIT branch. It's having a rewrite with a much
cleaner API, much more modular, much nicer internals etc. It includes things
that the old Ecore did not. It's MUCH MUCH MUCH better. It basically needs
lots of modules and will be worked on ad-infinitum. Currently it has basic
IPC wrapping, X wrapping, Evas wrapping, job handling, basic event loop,
timers, idlers, signal to event translators, frame buffer driver. A higher
level IPC wrapper has been started to build on top of the lower level
connection handler thats now there. Ecore is literally the core of a lot of
programs to be worked on and gives the infrastructure to do all the basic
"running around" a program has to do internally.
</td></tr></table>

<p><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newstitle">
Ebits
</td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newsbody">
The current ebits does a lot, but is creaking at the edges. It was designed
to do much less than its being used to do now. It needs a complete re-design
and rethink taking into account how it's being used now and how it might be
in the future. This is on the "chopping block" right now and will be gotten
to in due course.
</td></tr></table>

<p><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newstitle">
EWL
</td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newsbody">
This is a very long-term project. It needs work but it will be a long time
coming till its all there.
</td></tr></table>

<p><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newstitle">
Ebg
</td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newsbody">
This is a simple background handling library. It may be that in future Ebits
takes over this role and maybe Ebg just becomes a convenience wrapper around
Ebits.
</td></tr></table>

<p><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newstitle">
Ebony
</td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newsbody">
Dependant on Ebg and Ebits (possibly) this is a tool to create background
files. It will need to be updated as the back-end libraries (Ebg and Ebits)
change.
</td></tr></table>

<p><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newstitle">
Etcher
</td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newsbody">
Dependant on Ebits - if Ebits changes, Etcher needs to change. This will
likely involve a complete rewrite at this stage as Ebits needs to be looked
at hard.
</td></tr></table>

<p><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newstitle">
Efsd
</td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newsbody">
Currently dormant, but a good subsystem for building file managers and
anything that needs to do file stuff. This might benefit from Ecore and its
IPC wrapping, making it much more efficient and streamlined.
</td></tr></table>

<p><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newstitle">
Entrance
</td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newsbody">
In progress at the moment, but also dependant on other subsystems, this
login/display manager is intended to give the E "look & feel" from login as
well. It probably could do with more people, testing, features etc.
</td></tr></table>

<p><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newstitle">
E17
</td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newsbody">
Dormant right now waiting on work on all the libraries/subsystems it depends
on. It will need a rewrite considering all the work going into the libraries
it depends on. For now consider it a glorified "test application".
</td></tr></table>

<p><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newstitle">
Etox
</td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newsbody">
Currently Etox's fate is "unknown". It's a good library and idea.
Abstracting higher-level text formatting, flowing etc. into a library and API
is good, but where exactly Etox will head from here, we don't know.
</td></tr></table>

<p><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newstitle">
Estyle
</td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newsbody"> 
Lower level than Etox, Estyle just does text string style handling, and
config parsing. It's fate is also currently unknown.
</td></tr></table>

<p><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newstitle">
Imlib2
</td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newsbody">
Imlib2 is complete (feature-wise) but internally needs updates. It needs to
use Freetype2 like Evas does. It could also do with some Doxygen documents
like Ecore, Eet and Evas have (in progress) right now. It probably could
do with some love and attention.
