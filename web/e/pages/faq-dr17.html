Why has DR17 taken so long?  The DR17 saga.
</td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newsbody">
The current stable release of the window manager is DR16.7.1, which was released
to the world on Aug 24th 2004.  The last stable release was DR16.5, which was
released to the world on Oct 27th 2000.  At that time work was already well underway
 toward DR17, Imlib2 1.0 was released on Oct 16th 2000 and EVAS v0.0.1 was released
 on Oct 24th 2000.
<p>Since that time the EFL has grown into a mature suite of libraries which are now capable of supporting the applications and window manager for Enlightenments DR17 release.  In the interim we saw a lot of people and code come and go.  GEVAS was a created to use EVAS with GTK, Eprog simplified EVAS, Ebits became the themeing and interface library for E applications, Etcher and Ebony were created as tools for creating Ebit themes and backgrounds, EFSD was written to support the file management for E which grew out of a prototype (EFM) that worked with DR16, not to mention an advanced prototype of the window manager itself!  But as the code matured and we moved closer to what we wanted DR17 to become it became clear that many of the components had already been pushed beyond their initial design and it was clear that they would need to be replaced.  The debates raged on whether to release what was there or start rewriting in order to get things done right the first time.</p> 
<p>As it should be, Raster decided he would not release code that would just need to be immediately replaced and that we'd need to get it right.  And so EVAS 0.6.0 gave way to a rewrite known for a short time as EVAS2, later renamed back to EVAS 1.0.  Ebits gave way to it's rewrite renamed to Edje, which meant that applications using Ebits were no longer needed (Etcher and Ebony).  EET was developed to more efficiently handle many of the tasks Edb was being used for, namely packing theme data and images.  And other libraries such as EWL and Etox went along for the ride evolving with EVAS.  Ecore was built to tie everything together and thus displaced Eprog.  And now that the back end is now roughly where it should be work on the replacement for the window manager can occur.  </p>
<p>
We know it has been a long frustrating wait for users and we appreciate everyones patience.  Enlightenment has a long proud history of producing the best ahead-of-it's-time eye-candy on the planet that is emulated for years to come, and we have no desire to release a half assed product just to make people happy for 2 or 3 days until they start complaining.  The results will be well worth the wait.  And if you're a developer there are plenty of toys for you to play with now.  If you aren't a developer you'll find no better or more inviting place to start learning than with the EFL.  The work being done to make the next generation of the Enlightenment Window Manager will bring a lot more than just some pretty borders around your Eterm, it will drive the development of graphical applications industry wide for several years to come.  </p>

What are the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL)?  
</td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newsbody">
In DR17s development cycle many new libraries have been created.  We collectively call these libraries "The Enlightenment Foundation Libraries" (or <a href="faq-efl.html">EFL</a>) to distinguish them from the window manager itself.  Please read the <a href="faq-efl.html">EFL FAQ</a> for further information.

When will DR17 be released?

The release date for DR17 is sometime in the distant future; a date unknown yet even to the developers themselves. The release day in fact will probably be something that just happens one day and not something in anyway planned.

What exactly do you mean by "DR17 will be a desktop shell?"
</td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newsbody">
It means that DR17 will combine features of a window manager and a file manager.  It will provide nicely integrated GUI elements for managing your desktop elements, both files and windows. It does *not* mean that DR17 will be another application framework like Gnome and KDE.

No. The API for epplets under DR17 will be completely different and therefore old epplets will not work.
