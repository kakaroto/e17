What is the  Enlightenment Window Manager?
</td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newsbody">
Enlightenment is a window manager for <a href="http://www.xfree86.org">X</a>.
Its design goal is to be as configurable as possible - in look AND in feel.
Enlightenment's current design aim is to become a desktop shell. That
means it will manage your application windows, being able to launch
applications, and also manage your files.

What are the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL)?  
</td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newsbody">
The Enlightenment Project is known for its window manager, but even more powerful
are the tools used to build that window manager.  Enlightenment DR15 and DR16 were
based around the Imlib library created by Rasterman to provide greater flexability,
speed and functionlity over the conventional image libraries of the time.  As the
window manager has grown, so has its need for more powerful libraries to draw on.
In DR17s development cycle more than 14 libraries have been created, and 9 are 
currently grouped together to form the basis of the applications and window manager
itself.  We collectively call these libraries "The Enlightenment Foundation Libraries"
(or EFL) to distinguish them from the window manager itself.  The core libraries
of the EFL are: EVAS, Imlib2, Ecore, EWD, Edb, EET, Estyle, Etox, and EWL.
</td></tr></table>

<p><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newstitle">
Why hasn't Enlightenment had a new release in 3 years!?!
</td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newsbody">
<p>
The current stable release of the window manager is DR16.5, which was released to the world on 
Oct 27th 2000.  At that time work was already well underway toward DR17, Imlib2 1.0 was released
on Oct 16th 2000 and EVAS v0.0.1 was released on Oct 24th 2000.  Since that time the EFL has
grown into a mature suite of libraries which are now capable of supporting the applications and
window manager for Enlightenments DR17 release.  In the interum we saw alot of people and code come
and go.  GEVAS was a created to use EVAS with GTK, Eprog simplified EVAS, Ebits became the theming
and interface library for E applications, Etcher and Ebony were created as tools for creating Ebit themes
and backgrounds, EFSD was written to support the file management for E which grew out of a prototype (EFM)
that worked with DR16, not to mention an advanced prototype of the window manager itself!  But as
the code matured and we moved closer to what we wanted DR17 to become it became clear that many of
the componants had already been pushed beyond their initial design and it was clear that they would need
to be replaced.  The debates raged on whether to release what was there or start rewritting 
in order to get things done right the first time.  As it should be, Raster descided he would not release
code that would just need to be immediately replace and that we'd need to get it right.  And so
EVAS 0.6.0 gave way to a rewrite known for a short time as EVAS2, later renamed back to EVAS 1.0.  Ebits
gave way to it's rewrite renamed to Edje, which ment that applications using Ebits were no longer needed (Etcher and
Ebony).  EET was developed to more efficiently handle many of the tasks Edb was being used for, namely
packing theme data and images.  And other libraries such as EWL and Etox went along for the ride evolving
with EVAS.  Ecore was built to tie everything together and thus displaced Eprog.  And now that the
back end is now roughly where it should be work on the replacement for the window manager can occur.
</p>

<p>
We know it has been a long frustrating wait for users and we appreciate everyones patients.  Enlightenment
has a long proud history of producing the best ahead-of-it's-time eye-candy on the planet that is emulated
for years to come, and we have no desire to release a half assed product just to make people happy for 2 or 3
days untill they start complaining.  The results will be well worth the wait.  And if your a developer
there is plenty of toys for you to play with now.  If you aren't a developer you'll find no better or more
inviting place to start learning than with the EFL.  The work being done to make the next generation of the Enlightenment
Window Manager will bring alot more than just some pretty borders around your Eterm, it will drive
the development of graphical applications industry wide for several years to come.

Extremely!  Primary developement of the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries is currently 
being done on Linux/X86.  Other platforms that are currently in use for development

Do people still use DR16?  
</td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newsbody">
Yes!  Hundreds of people use DR16 daily, possibly thousands.  As more and more users 
move to Linux and other UNIX platforms they are becoming aware of Enlightenment and making
it their window manager of choice.  As KDE and GNOME pick up more and more steam it becomes
harder to find a powerful, yet elegant window manager for the power user who wants simplicity,
flexability and functionality.  Enlightenment is often emulated, but never duplicated.
Many of the users who have left E for Fluxbox or Sawfish have eventually come back to the frey.

Pixelhead has also written a document on 
<a href="http://pixelhead.lostmypants.net/dr16borders.html">creating DR16 borders</a> that is very good.
Besides these the best way to learn is to unpack an etheme (its just a gziped tarball) and

I downloaded a theme from Freshmeat but its a tar.gz not an etheme, and I'm not sure what do to.
</td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newsbody">
We're not exactly sure why, but Freshmeat renames (theme).etheme's to (theme).tar.gz or (theme).tgz.
In most cases you simply need to rename the file from XXX.tgz to XXX.etheme and copy it into your 
themes directory.  There are one or two themes out there that actually are distrubuted as tarballs because
they require special fonts, so when you untar those themes you should get an etheme, a font, and possibly a README.
If you unpack and get a directory named after the theme then just rename it.

Why is Evas faster with software acceleration than than when I run it

When run with hardware acceleration Evas uses the GL libraries on your
system; this means that if you have Mesa installed then Evas will use
the Mesa GL liberties. Mesa however only provides software acceleration
and therefore will run slow compared to Evas's in-built software mode. If
you have a video card that supports hardware acceleration then you should
attempt to get the manufacturers own GL drivers for your computer and
install them making sure that none of the Mesa libraries are left behind
and that where needed symbolic links are made to the real drivers.

hardware acceleration by default and that you have Mesa GL libraries
installed on your system. If you don't have acceleration on your video
card then you should search for a way to switch to software acceleration
in the program.

Is there a packaged version of SGI's GLU Implementation for my computer
anywhere?

At present SGI's GLU Implementation is available only in the form of a
RedHat package from <a href="http://www.mesa3d.org/downloads/sgi.html">

Why is my CPU usage at 100% when I use a program running Evas?
</td></tr></table><table width="100%"><tr><td class="newsbody">
When used in software mode, Evas will use a lot of CPU. In hardware
mode however it depends on your OpenGL drivers. What a lot of drivers
do is limit buffer buffer swaps to vertical blanking gaps only. This
means that the buffers wont be swapped until the vertical blanking gap
is reached, however since there is no method of using interrupts under
Linux/X the GL drivers have to poll in a tight loop waiting for the gap.
Also if the GL libraries are accessing the GFX hardware directory then if the
hardware is busy then the app will sit and poll registers until the
hardware is ready. It's basically down to your OpenGL drivers. It's worth
noting as well that your CPU will be high whenever you run evas_test as
it is pushing your system to try and achieve the highest frame rate it
can, a situation that most software using Evas will never be in.
