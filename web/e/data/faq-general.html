What is the Enlightenment project?
@:news_body@
Enlightenment began as a window manager for <a href="http://www.xfree86.org">X</a>.
Its design goal is to be as configurable as possible - in look AND in feel.
Enlightenment's current design aim is to become a desktop shell. That
means it will manage your application windows, being able to launch
applications, and also manage your <a href="http://evidence.sourceforge.net">files</a>.

Why hasn't Enlightenment had a new major release in 3 years!?!
@:news_body@
Extensive work has been done creating a set of foundation libraries for the next Enlightenment release for more information see the <a href="faq-efl.html">EFL FAQ</a>.

<p>
We know it has been a long frustrating wait for users and we appreciate everyone's patience. Enlightenment has a long proud history of producing the best ahead-of-it's-time eye-candy on the planet that is emulated for years to come, and we have no desire to release a half assed product just to make people happy for 2 or 3 days until they start complaining.  The results will be well worth the wait.

What is the meaning of the release versions: E 17 and DR17 or 0.17?
@:news_body@
"DR" stands for Development Release.  The current stable window manager can be called any of the following, E 0.16.5, E 16.5 or DR16.5 it's all the same thing.  Which you use is a matter of personal preference.

I'd like to <a href="join.html">contribute!</a> But I don't code!
@:news_body@
We can always use a hand.  Create themes or backgrounds, write documention or tutorials, and help others around you and on IRC.  If you've always wanted to code, the <a href="faq-efl.html">EFL</a> will make it easy for you, so start learning and share your experience with others in the form of a tutorial.

Where can I get new themes?  How can I create my own?
