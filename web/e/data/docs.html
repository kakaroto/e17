<!-- --------------------- E DR16 DOCS (User Interface) -------------------- -->
<p align="center"><b>Enlightenment 0.16.x</b></p>

<p>There is ample documentation available from Enlightenment itself. When you
have Enlightenment 0.16 running for the first time, you will get a screen
looking like this:</p>

<p><a href="shots/g1.jpg"><img src="shots/g1.gif" alt="E16 Inital Screen" border="0" height="96" width="128" /></a></p>

<p>The window you see in the middle is Dox, Enlightenment's online helpviewer.
It tells you everything about handling and configuring Enlightenment. You can
view this help at any time by pressing the middle mouse button on the desktop
and selecting the "Help" entry from the popup menu.</p>

<!-- --------------------- E DR17 DOCS (User Interface) -------------------- -->
<p align="center"><b>Enlightenment 0.17</b></p>

<p>You will find documentation on how to use and configure E 0.17 here when
the time's right. At the moment, E 17's codebase is not considered ready for
public consumption. <b>IF</b> you try E 17, please do <b>NOT</b> come to the
<a href="mail.html">mailing lists</a>
with questions like "Nothing happens!", "Why doesn't feature XYZ exist" etc.</p>
