What are the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL)?  
@:news_body@
The Enlightenment Project is known for its window manager, but even more powerful are the tools used to build that window manager.  Enlightenment DR15 and DR16 were based around the Imlib library created by Rasterman to provide greater flexibility, speed and functionality over the conventional image libraries of the time.  As the window manager has grown, so has its need for more powerful libraries to draw on.  In DR17s development cycle more than 14 libraries have been created, and 10 are currently grouped together to form the basis of the applications and window manager itself.  We collectively call these libraries "The Enlightenment Foundation Libraries" (or <a href="faq-efl.html">EFL</a>) to distinguish them from the window manager itself.  The core libraries of the <a href="faq-efl.html">EFL</a> are: Evas, Imlib2, Ecore, EDB, EET, Embryo, Edje, Esmart, Etox, and EWL.

<p>Additional libraries include: Emotion, Epeg, Epsilon, and Evoak.</p>

What about these other libraries and applications in CVS?
@:news_body@
During the course of development for EFL there have been some libraries that are now considered "dead", and others have been combined into 1 library.  Applications that depended on some of these old libraries are now defunct. Below is a brief list of things that will probably <b>not</b> be ressurected.

<p><b>Libraries</b><br>
<ul>
   <li>EWD - merged with Ecore</li>
   <li>Estyle - merged with Etox</li>
</ul>
<b>Applications</b><br>
<ul>
   <li>MED</li>
   <li>EFM - replaced by <a href="http://evidence.sourceforge.net">evidence</a>.</li>
   <li>Ebony - made obsolete by EET.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Some applications <b>may</b> be re-written to work under the latest EFL, these include:
<ul>
   <li>Etcher - A theme creation/editor utility</li>
   <li>EFSD - Filesystem monitoring (see: <a href="http://evidence.sourceforge.net">evidence</a>)</li>
   <li>eBindings - Menu and Keyboard bindings app for DR17</li>
</ul>

<a name="Portable"></a>
Are the EFL portable?
@:news_body@
Extremely!  Primary development of the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries is currently being done on Linux/X86.  Other platforms that are currently in use for development include Linux/PPC, Linux/Sparc, Solaris/Sparc, FreeBSD, and OSX.  PDAs can use the EFL on Qtopia (Zaurus) and most iPaq Linux distributions.

<h3>Evas</h3>

@:news_title@
<a name="GLaccel"></a>
Why is Evas faster with software acceleration than than when I run it with hardware acceleration switched on?
@:news_body@
When run with hardware acceleration Evas uses the GL libraries on your system; this means that if you have Mesa installed then Evas will use the Mesa GL liberties. Mesa however only provides software acceleration and therefore will run slow compared to Evas's built-in software mode. If you have a video card that supports hardware acceleration then you should attempt to get the manufacturers own GL drivers for your computer and install them making sure that none of the Mesa libraries are left behind and that where needed symbolic links are made to the real drivers.

Why is 'program x' which uses Evas so slow?
@:news_body@
See last question. The chance is that the program is trying to use hardware acceleration by default and that you have Mesa GL libraries installed on your system. If you don't have acceleration on your video card then you should search for a way to switch to software acceleration in the program.

<a name="EvasCPU"></a>
Why is my CPU usage at 100% when I run a program using Evas?
@:news_body@
When used in software mode, Evas will use a lot of CPU. In hardware mode however it depends on your OpenGL drivers. What a lot of drivers do is limit buffer swaps to vertical blanking gaps only. This means that the buffers won't be swapped until the vertical blanking gap is reached, however since there is no method of using interrupts under Linux/X the GL drivers have to poll in a tight loop waiting for the gap.  Also if the GL libraries are accessing the GFX hardware directory then if the hardware is busy then the app will sit and poll registers until the hardware is ready. It's basically down to your OpenGL drivers. It's worth noting as well that your CPU will be high whenever you run evas_test as it is pushing your system to try and achieve the highest frame rate it can, a situation that most software using Evas will never be in.
