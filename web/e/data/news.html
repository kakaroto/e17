@:news_body@
A lot of work is underway.  The web team is working to get more developement 
resources brought to the pages and continually improving what we have so far.
The development crew is plugging away at various projects. 
cK is moving by leaps and bounds on EFSD and its <a href="docs.html">documentation</a>, 
Raster finished the <a href="docs.html">Evas Programmers Guide</a>.  All developers should
check out these new docs, lots of goodies in there for ya.
Great things are coming..........

Sat Jun 02 - <a href="mailto:cK@@whoop.org">cK</a> - Website redesign
@:news_body@
Finished a general website overhaul, added a stylesheet and began a FAQ section.
I hope you like the new looks. Btw, no, we're not dead -- unfortunately the
active developers are pretty busy right now, so please be patient :)

@:news_body@
After a lot of ranting and arguing on the development mailing list, I decided
to jump earlier than I expected to and make some changes. No more spinning
logo. No more png files (a note to browser authors: shame on you for supporting
them so horribly, that is not anyone's idea of "web compliant"). Etc. Send
change requests to me.

@:news_body@
Tonight the website got reformatted and done. It got cleaned up and now has
configuration files and templates so the look is very easily separated from
the feel. It has build scripts and has a new (cleaner) look to it. It is not
complete, but it will be filled in over time.
