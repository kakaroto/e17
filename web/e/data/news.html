Fri Jun 6 - <a href="mailto:benr@@NO.SPAMcuddletech.com">benr</a> - Enlightenment DR16.6-pre3 is avalible for testing!
@:news_body@
<p>
We've looked and looked for someone to pick up DR16 and start working on it, handling upgrades and small fixes here and there, and we got just want we wanted.  <a href="team.html">Kim Woelders</a> (kwu) has taken over as the owner and maintainer of DR16.  He's been working hard and released pre3 to the world and is asking all the testing we can give, so grab it and report back to the <a href="mail.html">e-devel mailing list</a> with bugs if you find them.  <a href=" http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2">You can get 16.6-pre3 on the SF files page</a>.  There are numberous changes, so please read the change logs or <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/enlightenment/e16/e/">browse CVSweb</a>, but some highlights include: De-iconify to current desk and viewport, Native cursor support, Many tweaks and bug fixes for Extended Window Manager Hint code (i.e. GNOME2/KDE3 compatibility), Unshade shaded windows when selected from window lists, and fixes for hidden theme buttons... and thats just the highlights of changes since -pre2.

Wed Apr 9 - <a href="mailto:benr@@NO.SPAMcuddletech.com">benr</a> - Raster puts weight of E behind XCB
@:news_body@
<p>
<a href="mailto:raster@@n00-SpAmmm.rasterman.com">Raster</a> has decided to put some push behind <a href="http://xcb.cs.pdx.edu/">the XCB project</a>.  You can see his <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=1945128&forum_id=6427">original message here</a>.  So run over and grab the source, play with it, and get crackin'.
</p>

<p>
And don't forget, we are still seeking a variety of developers of various different skillsets, particularly to work on EWL.  Work is being done on DR16.5 for a possible 16.6 release, so patches are welcome and encouraged, but get them in soon.  And as always, the more code written using the libs the more there is for others to benefit from, so grab the libs (Ecore and EVAS particularly) and just build some kool apps.

Thur Jan 23 - <a href="mailto:benr@@NO.SPAMcuddletech.com">benr</a> - EVAS Made Simpler!
@:news_body@
<p>A link has been added in regards to the project undertaken by <a href="team.html">rephorm</a>, <a href="http://www.rephorm.com/rephorm/code/eprog/">Eprog</a>.  Eprog is a convenence library for EVAS.  Just as Ecore simplifies the proccess of interacting with X, Eprog simplifies the proccess of getting an EVAS.  The best description for Eprog so far was "damnit, just give me a canvas!".  Potential programmers who think EVAS is over their heads will definately want to take a look.  Rephorm (origonal contributer of the Iconbar code) has also written an <a href="http://www.rephorm.com/rephorm/code/iconbar/">iconbar in Eprog</a>, which can be used with almost any window manager, so if you only want to run DR17 for the snazy iconbar, check it out while you wait for Enlightenment DR17 to mature.</p>
<p>If you're still running DR16 but sick of your old themes, you should check out the themes created by <a href="team.html">pixelhead</a>.  He's been creating some really impressive themes for DR16.5 and has brought a breath of fresh air to an aging collection of vintage themes.  You can find his themes <a href="http://pixelhead.lostmypants.net/">here</a> and <a href="http://pixelmasochist.deviantart.com/">here</a>.  For more themes, don't forget to dig thru the <a href="http://themes.freshmeat.net/browse/59/?topic_id=59">theme section at Freshmeat</a> and <a href="http://www.themedepot.org/">Theme Depot</a>.   No matter how many other window managers there are, E is still the king of kool.</p>

Wed Jan 22 - <a href="mailto:benr@@NO.SPAMcuddletech.com">benr</a> - Merge Mania
@:news_body@
<p>SPLIT has been merged.  This means that as of last week, SPLIT is effectively dead.  All checkouts should occur from the primary branch (known as HEAD).  The only current exception is Ecore.  Ecore is currently in a re-write process by raster, so if you want the "old" Ecore, HEAD is the place to go, but if you want to test or sneek a peek at the new API, grab it out of SPLIT.</p>
<p>Ecore is so far the second major rewrite to occur, EVAS being the first.  In a desire to make DR17 a perfect release, raster wants the libraries to be as complete and full featured as possible before any type of release.  Once Ecore is done, and it nearly is, Ebits will be next on the chopping block.  The current theming model will be laid away and replaced with a vastly improved system based on the concepts and experiences of Ebits.  Enlightenment, the window manager, that is currently in CVS (e) will also be laid away and completely re-written from scratch based on the experience and concepts of what we currently have.  The rewrite for E itself is a ways off, but you should be prepared for it now.</p>
<p>The best way for anyone wanting to help now is to use and explore the libraries we currently have.  Whether you are advanced or a beginner something is there for you to get your teeth into.  Please try them out, get a feel and let us know how you like them.  No major changes are anticipated for Imlib2 or EVAS moving forward and Ecore's new API is stabilizing in SPLIT .  Anyone who has ever tried to use X directly will greatly enjoy Ecore's "just give me a window damnit" approach and easy handling techniques, so please give it a try and let us know how you like it.</p>

Fri Dec 26 -  <a href="mailto:benr@@NO.SPAMcuddletech.com">benr</a> - A long, fruitful year
@:news_body@
<p>It's been a long year for the team, but a fruitful one.  DR16.5 is still in heavy usage and will stay so for many years to come.  DR17 has seen the bulk of the backend work done.  EVAS has picked up a following and gained some press.  While at the same time we've seen several developers leave the project as they move onto different parts of their lives.</p>


<p>As this project is constantly fighting the "is E dead?" battle, it's important to point out that this project  has always been as much, if not more so, about libraries than the window manager that we all know and love.  Imlib is still in heavy usage, Imlib2 has become a critical part of many projects.  EVAS is going to be a significant force in the future, and will be as big a hit as Imlib.  Not only that, our library collection includes a full widget library (EWL) based on EVAS, several convenience libs (Ecore, Eprog, EWD), libraries for text rendering in EVAS (Etox, Estyle), a packaging and distribution format (EET), a database (EDB), and a revolutionary themeing scheme (Ebits, Ebg).  Not to mention tools for EDB (e_gtk_ed, Ebindings, etc), and Ebits/Ebg (Ebony, Etcher).  We've got the file manager backend completed (EFSD).  We've got a widget daemon (Ewidgetd), one of the nicest image viewers ever written (Entice), and two file managers (Essence, <a href="http://evidence.sourceforge.net/">Evidence</a>).  And there is more than that!  We're running out of words that start with E.  For the last 2 years the E project is closer in scale (not goal) to KDE and GNOME than any other of the desktop projects.  E will be a complete desktop shell, and we've been laying the groundwork toward that end.</p>

<p>To take a look at where we are, go to the <a href="source.html">CVS sources page</a> and check out the SPLIT branch.  In the last year, E broke CVS into two branches the so-called "stable" main branch for users (known as HEAD) and the development branch which has been very unstable (known as SPLIT).   As code becomes more stable it is planned to be merged back into HEAD, but most of this hasn't been completed yet. So far EVAS (formerly known as EVAS2) and EET have been merged back into HEAD, so keep an eye on the CVS sources page to make sure you are using the correct current code.   Before checking out the source please read <a href="cvsnotes.html">the build notes</a> and README's for each codebase since they have very specific requirements.  As usual, the E team doesn't support ANYTHING in CVS... everything is still in heavy development and subject to changes at any time.</p>

<p>And speaking of changes, EVAS programmers who haven't looked at EVAS lately should.  EVAS was reworked completely in the SPLIT branch as EVAS2 and recently merged back into HEAD.  This rework includes some major API changes.  Any coders who have used EVAS in their projects at some point should take a look and update your applications.  The EVAS2 code in SPLIT is now dead, and EVAS proper in HEAD is current.  For other updates regarding EVAS look at <a href="http://www.rasterman.com/pages/news.html">Raster's news page</a>.</p>

<p>While the window manager isn't complete yet, you can clearly see that any programmer has plenty of toys to play with.  The common joke is that when we're done the window manager will be written in 5 lines of C.  Some truly great things are coming thanks to all the hard work from Raster, Rephorm, Atmos, RbdPngn, Tillsan, Vac, and many others.</p>
<p>Happy New Year from the Enlightenment crew!</p>

Tue Jul 30 -  <a href="mailto:benr@@NO.SPAMcuddletech.com">benr</a> - Charging on 
@:news_body@
<p>A new and happy addition has been made to the Enlightenment family, <a href="mailto:mind@@NO.SPAMmindbox.mine.nu">mind</a> has started a series of <a href="http://e1x.mine.nu/">user support forums</a> to aid in the support of E.  It should be noted that these forums are <b>unofficial</b> and not backed by the Enlightenment project or its core developers, but we're glad to see users taking an active intrest in helping where they can.  Check them out and post post post. </p>

<p>In other news, as many have no doubt read, Raster was recently <a href="http://www.linuxandmain.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=141">interviewed</a> and the story made it to <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/07/20/1342205&mode=thread&tid=106">slashdot</a>.  Please, if you have not already, read <a href="http://www.rasterman.com/pages/news.html">Raster's comments on the interview</a>.  You find things greatly clarified.</p>

<p>As development goes right now, we're trucking along.  Many of the big changes are being put on hold while Raster is overhauling EVAS.  The progress of EVAS is amazing, and can only be appreciated properly when you've seen what it can truely do.  Once EVAS is completed many of the other compontants of DR17 which are based on EVAS will get worked on, building upward toward E DR17 itself over time.  </p>

Well, raster's started working on DR17-related stuff again, so look for some
new code to be checked in by him soon.

<p>Elsewhere, a few <a href="http://www.osdn.com/">OSDN</a> folks finally got
tired of the sorry state themes.org was in, and moved it. Our part of the new
themes.org (which is really part of
<a href="http://freshmeat.net/">freshmeat</a>) can be found
<a href="http://themes.freshmeat.net/browse/60/?topic_id=60">here</a>. They're
calling on theme authors to "claim ownership" of their work, and for people to
help them get the site on track and fully converted over to using the fm][
codebase. More information on the announcement can be found on

Thur Mar 28 -  <a href="mailto:benr@@NO.SPAMcuddletech.com">benr</a> - DR17 kicks into high gear
@:news_body@
I'm very happy to report that progress is happening rapidly and there are very
tangible results.  Long months were spent working on the libraries which formed
the foundation of DR17, and it has paid off in a very nice windowing
environment that is fairly usable.  However, because the focus has been on
developing these libraries, the Enlightenment "window manager" is still merely
a shell by which to test, and not a true taste of what will exist when it nears
completion.  Though it does look very appealing in screen shots, do not judge
it by what it is today because there is a lot more to come.

<p>Some of the real magic is happening right now on the components that will
form the file management aspects of DR17, which will be isolated from the E
package directly.  Originally these functions were to be built directly into E,
however the developers felt it would be wiser to build separate libraries to
handle these functions to allow for easier maintenance and expansion, and hence
a cleaner more distinct back end.  For people who have used DR17 and wondered
why they can't do much more than copy files between views, this is the work
that will interest you.</p>

<p>The development that I just mentioned is currently happening in a separate
branch of CVS.  The reason being that the developers realized that many people
are currently using and experimenting with DR17 from CVS, and their work is
going to break most of the modules for a while as they get the core work done,
this allows them to work without bothering users.  We should all be thankful
that they did this, so we can all continue to enjoy DR17 while they work.
There is currently, as always, no time frame as to when they will be done, and
there will naturally be some problems, but when the development gets to a point
that the developers feel it's ready, they will be integrating the code back
into the main CVS modules.  Until then it is recommended that anyone developing
based on current CVS be aware that any changes they make could be impacted by
the merge when they are done and to be prepared for any conflicts, should they
occur.</p>

Sun Mar 3 - <a href="mailto:benr@@NO.SPAMcuddletech.com">benr</a> - Its time to get to work
@:news_body@
If you are one of the casual watchers of the Enlightenment project and don't
watch the mailing lists or the CVS commit list you're really missing some
magic.  Though it may appear that the project is moving along slowly, consider
its complexity and scope.  Just look at the
<a href="components.html">components list</a>.
A lot has been done and a lot more is coming. 

<p>DR17 has progressed to a point now where its time for interested parties to
start lending a hand.  <a href="etcher.html">Etcher</a> and
<a href="ebony.html">Ebony</a> are still under development, but the tools are
very usable.  It's time to start getting themes ready for Enlightenment and
EWL.  This is by no means a suggestion that Enlightenment or EWL are ready for
wide use, but if you are one of the people who always wanted to get involved in
a project but didn't know how you could help, here is your cue.  You can find a
tutorial on Etcher and Ebony on the <a href="docs.html">docs page</a>.  You'll
find Etcher intimidating at first, but will quickly learn to love it and the
possibilities and ease it provides.  Enjoy.</p>

Thanks to Term's efforts the webpage finally updates again out of CVS. Yay!
Things have changed a good deal since the last news update -- things are going
a good deal slower as before, mainly because nobody around is able to spend a
large amount of time on the code right now. This is a great time if you want
to become involved -- read the code, get familiar with it, come to the
developer's list and ask questions. Discussions there are gaining a good
deal of momentum right now. Brian Mattern (aka rephorm) has put a lot of
effort into making the next generation of epplets happen, you're welcome
to have a look and give it a try.
