Sat Nov 17 - <a href="mailto:cK@@NO.SPAMwhoop.org">cK</a> - The webpage is back, documentation is growing
@:news_body@
Our apologies for the recent downtime of the website, it is back in full swing
now. If you're interested in the E17 codebase but didn't know where to
start, we have a documentation system in place now for every module, and
documentation is growing. Please refer to the doc subdirectory of each
module for details. HTML versions of the manuals will be put up shortly.

Wed Nov 7 - <a href="mailto:benr@@NO.SPAMcuddletech.com">benr</a> - Exciting time for Enlightenment
@:news_body@
The last several weeks have been very exciting.  Most of the different modules
of Enlightenment are used now in E17. Though the CVS codebase isn't ready for
public consumption yet, the libraries and applications are coming along well.
If you are a programmer I suggest looking into
<a href="imlib2.html">Imlib2</a> and <a href="evas.html">Evas</a>, or
<a href="ebits.html">Ebits</a> and <a href="edb.html">Edb</a>.  A lot of
development has happened on <a href="ewl.html">EWL</a> and 
<a href="ewd.html">Ewd</a>.

Sat Oct 13 - Andrew S - New mailing list archives
@:news_body@
Huzzah! Though our current mailing list archiving service, Geocrawler,
continues to <a href="http://www.geocrawler.com/about/">run on autopilot</a>
and cannot archive new lists, the friendly people at MARC are now archiving
all of our lists (including enlightenment-users). The MARC service includes
the ability to search through archived messages. Props go to Claus Niesen
for getting the e-users list added and letting us know - thanks Claus! For
more information, head on over to the enlightenment.org 
<a href="mail.html">mailing list page</a>.

Fri Jul 27 - <a href="mailto:term@@NO.SPAMkempler.net">Term</a> - More documentation
@:news_body@
We haven't updated the news in a while, but not a lot has been happening
recently. <a href="mailto:cK@@NO.SPAMwhoop.org">cK</a> continues working on
efsd, and <a href="mailto:raster@@NO.SPAMrasterman.com">raster</a> has started
coding again, after spending a lot of time writing a very complete
<a href="pdf/evas.pdf">PDF</a> documenting Evas. I finally got around to
<a href="htmlized/evas/">htmlizing</a>, too. Check it out.

Sat Jun 02 - <a href="mailto:cK@@NO.SPAMwhoop.org">cK</a> - Website redesign
@:news_body@
Finished a general website overhaul, added a stylesheet and began a FAQ section.
I hope you like the new looks. Btw, no, we're not dead -- unfortunately the
active developers are pretty busy right now, so please be patient :)

Sun Apr 22 - <a href="mailto:term@@NO.SPAMkempler.net">Term</a> - Website fixup
@:news_body@
After a lot of ranting and arguing on the development mailing list, I decided
to jump earlier than I expected to and make some changes. No more spinning
logo. No more png files (a note to browser authors: shame on you for supporting
them so horribly, that is not anyone's idea of "web compliant"). Etc. Send
change requests to me.

Sun Apr 15 - <a href="mailto:raster@@NO.SPAMrasterman.com">Raster</a> - Website redo
@:news_body@
Tonight the website got reformatted and done. It got cleaned up and now has
configuration files and templates so the look is very easily separated from
the feel. It has build scripts and has a new (cleaner) look to it. It is not
complete, but it will be filled in over time.
