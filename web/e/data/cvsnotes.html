<p class="contenttitle">E17 CVS Build Notes</p>
<p>After getting E17 from CVS you'll go through the length task of building each
of its dependencies. Below you'll find an ordered list that will help you build
E. Please note that when we say "build" we're talking about a four stage
process of: ./autogen.sh, ./configure (if autogen.sh doesn't run it for you),
make, make install. If all goes well you should shoot right through the list. If
you have previously installed E17 and its libs your order will be different,
this list is for fresh installs only. It is generally recommended that any
existing installations of E17 or any of its components be completely removed
prior to a build, to avoid the problem we often see where the wrong versions of
the libraries get linked.</p>

<p><b>If you have problems building the source, the most common problems involve
old versions of the build tools.  If you can't even get autogen.sh to run properly
you should update libtool, automake, autoconf, and gettext.  It's also to have
problems with multiple aclocal directories (ie: both /usr/share/aclocal 
and /usr/local/share/aclocal) which you should fix.  <font color="red">Enlightenment DOES 
build! If it doesn't build, then it is YOUR PROBLEM.  There are people watching almost
every commit and testing changes as quick as they are made, problems are being fixed
faster than they can break the build.  If ANY part of E17 doesn't build DO NOT contact the list,
developers or other people associated with the project, they can't help you debug your broken linux 
box.</font></b></p>

<p>People are working currently on getting E CVS working on Solaris/SPARC
and FreeBSD/x86.</p>

<p>After the build is complete you should make sure FAM is running, edit your
.xinitrc and startx.</p>

<p>Currently no support is available for E17 build issues. Don't contact the
developers directly unless you are positive you've found a bug!  If you want
to talk to others you can try the IRC channel, but no guarrenties.
Enjoy.</p>
