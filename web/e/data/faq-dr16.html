Do people still use DR16?  
@:news_body@
Yes!  Hundreds of people use DR16 daily, possibly thousands.  As more and more users 
move to Linux and other UNIX platforms they are becoming aware of Enlightenment and making
it their window manager of choice.  As KDE and GNOME pick up more and more steam it becomes
harder to find a powerful, yet elegant window manager for the power user who wants simplicity,
flexibility and functionality.  Enlightenment is often emulated, but never duplicated.
Many of the users who have left E for Fluxbox or Sawfish have eventually come back to the fray.

<a name="NewThemes"></a>
I'm tired of the old themes!  Isn't there anything new?
@:news_body@
The Enlightenment Project currently has 2 <a href="team.html">team themers</a> who have been providing 
new <b>original</b> themes for DR16.  <a href="http://pixelhead.lostmypants.net/">Pixelhead</a> 
and <a href="http://tokyo.cored.org/">Tokyo</a>.  Both have been creating themes that will make your friends
who stopped using E a long time ago drool with envy.  Enlightenment is still the king of the eye-candy universe.

@:news_title@
<a name="ThemeHowTo"></a>
Is there a manual or HOWTO on building themes?
@:news_body@
Yes, a basic set of documents can be found thanks to Tokyo and the 
<a href="www.etherdoxproject.org">EtherDox Project</a> setup by Peter "monkiboi" Watts.
Pixelhead has also written a document on 
<a href="http://pixelhead.lostmypants.net/dr16borders.html">creating DR16 borders</a> that is very good.
Besides these the best way to learn is to unpack an etheme (its just a gziped tarball) and
look at how its setup.  (This is also why 90% of the themes look alike.)
@:news_end@

@:news_title@
<a name="InstallThemes"></a>
How do I install themes?
@:news_body@
Copy the .etheme file to your $HOME/.enlightenment/themes/ directory and restart E.
@:news_end@

@:news_title@
<a name="Etheme"></a>
I downloaded a theme from Freshmeat but its a tar.gz not an etheme, and I'm not sure what do to.
@:news_body@
We're not exactly sure why, but Freshmeat renames (theme).etheme's to (theme).tar.gz or (theme).tgz.
In most cases you simply need to rename the file from XXX.tgz to XXX.etheme and copy it into your 
themes directory.  There are one or two themes out there that actually are distributed as tarballs because
they require special fonts, so when you untar those themes you should get an etheme, a font, and possibly a README.
If you unpack and get a directory named after the theme then just rename it.

@:news_title@
<a name="platforms"></a>
What platforms does E DR16 run on?
@:news_body@
The primary development platform is Linux.  Binaries exist for Solaris/SPARC,
AIX, *BSD, IRIX, and GNU Darwin.  Other tested platforms include: Tru64, HP-UX,
and OS/2.
@:news_end@

@:news_title@
<a name="StillDevDR16"></a>
Is DR16 still in development?
@:news_body@
Yes!  DR16 went thru a long hibernation as it's developers devoted all their
efforts toward DR17.  While there was still room for improvement in
DR16 the primary focus shifted and DR16 was left without an owner or maintainer.
Patches were commited from time to time, but it wasn't until the first half
of 2003 that Kim Woelders (kwo) took up the call to become the DR16 owner and 
began devoting time to working on improvements and bug fixes.  DR16.7.1 was
released on Aug 24, 2004 and development on this series continues.
@:news_end@

@:news_title@
<a name="PatchSubmit"></a>
Where can I submit a patch for DR16?
@:news_body@
Send it to <a href="team.html">kwo</a>.  Make sure you have the latest version of
the code before submiting your patch to ensure someone hasn't beaten you to it.
@:news_end@

@:news_title@
<a name="NoDragbar"></a>
Can I get rid of that bar at the top of my screen?
@:news_body@
Yes, it's called a drag bar and allows you to drag from one desktop to another without using the pager.
You can disable it on the "Special FX Settings" dialog by unchecking "Display desktop dragbar".
@:news_end@


@:news_title@
<a name="DR16Tools"></a>
Are there tools that can help me customize E?  How can I setup key bindings?
@:news_body@
Yes, there are 2 apps that can be found <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2">
in the SourceForge files area</a> to help. E16KeyEdit for editing E key bindings and E16MenuEdit
which is a nice GTK menu editor.  Note that the tool E-Conf is no longer supported or available.
@:news_end@

@:news_title@
<a name="Backgrounds"></a>
How do I add new backgrounds?
@:news_body@
Simply copy the new background into your $HOME/.enlightenment/backgrounds/ directory.
Any subdirectories under the backgrounds directory will show up in the Backgrounds menu as
a new sub-menu.
@:news_end@

@:news_title@
<a name="AddToMenu"></a>
How do I add new programs to the "User Applications List" menu?
@:news_body@
Edit the file $HOME/.enlightenment/user_apps.menu and add your program on a new line
in the following form: "Program Name" NULL exec "command --arg1 --arg2"
<p>You can also use e16menuedit for a GUI interface to editing this file.  It is available in most distributions as a separate package.
@:news_end@

@:news_title@
<a name="AddNewMenu"></a>
How can I add a new user menu?
@:news_body@
Edit the file $HOME/.enlightenment/file.menu and add a new menu using the form:
"Menu Name" NULL menu "menu_name.menu".  Now create a menu file using the name
you chose using the same format as the the user_apps.menu.  Menus can have 
sub-menus using the same method as in the file.menu.  The first line
of each menu file will serve as the name of the menu.
@:news_end@

@:news_title@
<a name="MenuExec"></a>
I added a new menu item that uses quotes and my program doesn't seem to execute properly.
@:news_body@
You will need to alternate double and single quotes (ie: "command -arg 'my arg'") or if you
still have problems wrap the command in a shell script and execute the shell script instead.

@:news_title@
<a name="WhereEpplets"></a>
Where can I get epplets?  How can I write my own?
@:news_body@
You can find the source package and RPMs on <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2">
the SourceForge files page</a>.  The best way to learn how to write new Epplets is 
to crack open the source and take a peak, they are pretty simple to write.
@:news_end@

@:news_title@
<a name="ManyEpplets"></a>
My epplets keep multiplying whenever I launch E. Help!
@:news_body@
That's a bug in the Epplet library. The latest releases of enlightenment don't have this problem.<br>  
For the adventurous, you need to remove all bogus epplet entries from ~/.enlightenment/...e_session-XXXXXX.snapshots.0 while E isn't running. A more radical approach is to simply delete this file -- this may cause other settings to be lost, such as those for the icon box and the pagers.  An even better method proposed by digitalfallout is to use the following sed line to clean up the dups and make a backup: sed -i.bak -e '/[0-9]\.Epplet$/,/^CMD:/d' .enlightenment/...e_session-XXXXXX.snapshots.0
@:news_end@

@:news_title@
<a name="RememberSettings"></a>
Why can't E remember my desktop when I exit? 
@:news_body@
E is not, and does not contain or use, a session manager.  If you want this type of 
functionality you can use an external session manager to do it for you.  Popular session
managers include xsm (check the man page), and
<a href="http://rox.sourceforge.net/rox_session.html">ROX-Session</a>.
<br>
For remembering individual application settings use the "alt-right-click - Remember..." menu.

How can I get icons and file management in DR16?
@:news_body@
Thanks to the <a href="http://www.etherdoxproject.org/">EtherDox Project</a>
a <a href="http://www.etherdoxproject.org/index.php?id=how+to+add+icons+to+your+E+desktop">tutorial 
on adding icons to DR16</a> is avalible.  This tutorial details the proccess of
modifying an E theme to present icons.  Please note that this proccess is theme dependant,
you must modify each theme you wish to have icons.  These icons will provide app
loading, but not a filemanager.
Another popular choice is <a href="http://rox.sourceforge.net/">
The ROX Desktop</a> which can run ontop of Enlightenment.  When supported, you 
can also use GNOME and KDE on top of E.
@:news_end@

@:news_title@
<a name="LearnDR16"></a>
I'm not sure how to use all of E's features, how can I learn?
@:news_body@
On the main drop down menu (middle-click) choose help and read thru all the pages
to learn all the diffrent ways you can utilize E more efficiently.  Also, if tooltips
aren't enabled (the clouds when you don't move your mouse)  you can enable them
in the Settings menu by choosing "Tooltip Settings...".
