What is Enlightenment?
@:news_body@
Enlightenment is a window manager for <a href="http://www.xfree86.org">X</a>.
Its design goal is to be as configurable as possible - in look AND in feel.
Enlightenment's current design aim is to become a desktop shell. That
means it will manage your application windows, being able to launch
applications, and also manage your files.

What's E's relation to Gnome and KDE? Is Gnome supported? Is KDE supported?
@:news_body@
E 16 supports both Gnome and KDE. In E 17, you will be able to use both Gnome
and KDE *applications*. However, given that E 17 will be a desktop shell, this
doesn't mean that all parts of the frameworks (such as desktop-oriented file managers)
will work.
@:news_end@

@:news_title@
What platforms does E run on?
@:news_body@
The primary development platform is Linux. *BSD and Solaris are
also supported. HP, Irix, AIX should more or less work, but are
probably adventurous.

@:news_title@
I'd like to contribute! How can I commit code?
@:news_body@
Send patches! If they're good you'll get a CVS account.

@:news_title@
My epplets keep multiplying whenever I launch E. Help!
@:news_body@
That's a bug in the Epplet library. For the adventurous, you need to
remove all bogus epplet entries from
~/.enlightenment/...e_session-XXXXXX.snapshots.0 while E isn't
running. A more radical approach is to simply delete this file --
this may cause other settings to be lost, such as those for the
icon box and the pagers. Sorry for the inconvenience.

<p align="center">E17</p>

@:news_title@
When will E 17 be released?
@:news_body@
The release date for E17 is sometime in the distant future; a date
unknown yet even to the developers themselves. The release day in fact will 
probably be something that just happens one day and not something in
anyway planned.
@:news_end@

@:news_title@
What exactly do you mean by "E 17 will become a desktop shell?"
@:news_body@
It means that E 17 combines features of a window manager and a file manager.
It will provide nicely integrated GUI elements for managing your desktop
elements, both files and windows. It does *not* mean that E 17 is another
application framework like Gnome and KDE.
@:news_end@

@:news_title@
Will E 16's themes work with E 17?
@:news_body@
No. The theme formats are totally different. There is a chance though
that converters will exist at some point.
@:news_end@

@:news_title@
Will the epplets in E16 work under E17?
@:news_body@
No. The API for epplets under E17 will be completly diffrent and
therefore old epplets will not work.

<p align="center">EFSD</p>

@:news_title@
I heard EFSD needs FAM. What's that? What's Imon?
@:news_body@
FAM is the File Alteration Monitor, a server which reports
file modification events to clients. Imon is a Linux kernel patch
to improve performance, using it is highly recommended.
Read more about it at <a href="http://oss.sgi.com/projects/fam">SGI</a>.
@:news_end@

@:news_title@
Can I run EFSD without FAM? Do I need Imon?
@:news_body@
At the moment, FAM is necessary to run EFSD. Imon is not required in
order to use FAM/EFSD, but is recommended. You can get
both FAM and Imon at <a href="http://oss.sgi.com/projects/fam">SGI</a>. If the
server is down, we have a local copy of FAM's sources up on our
SourceForge <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2">files page</a>.
This version also fixes an annoying compilation bug.
@:news_end@

@:news_title@
I can't compile FAM. It dies with a "`NULL' undeclared (first use this function)" message.
@:news_body@
Add the line "#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;" to BTree.h. Alternatively, you can download
our copy which has this problem fixed on our SourceForge
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2">files page</a>.
@:news_end@

@:news_title@
Why don't you add support for browsing FTP, Tarballs etc to EFSD?
@:news_body@
Because that's not EFSD's job. EFSD's job is to provide a facility
for launching filesystem commands and asynchronously receiving replies *on
top* of the filesystem, not to extend it.

<p align="center">EVAS</p>

@:news_title@
<a name="a"></a>
Why is EVAS faster with software acceleration than than when I run it
with hardware acceleration switched on?
@:news_body@
When run with hardware acceleration EVAS uses the GL libraries on your
system; this means that if you have Mesa installed then EVAS will use
the Mesa GL liberties. Mesa however only provides software acceleration
and therefore will run slow compared to Evas's in-built software mode. If
you have a video card that supports hardware acceleration then you should
attempt to get the manufacturers own GL drivers for your computer and
install them making sure that none of the Mesa libraries are left behind
and that where needed symbolic links are made to the real drivers.
@:news_end@

@:news_title@
<a name="b"></a>
Why is 'program x' which uses EVAS so slow?
@:news_body@
See last question. The chance is that the program is trying to use
hardware acceleration by default and that you have Mesa GL libraries
installed on your system. If you don't have acceleration on your video
card then you should search for a way to switch to software acceleration
in the program.

Is there a packaged version of SGI's GLU Implementation for my computer
anywhere?
@:news_body@
At present SGI's GLU Implementation is available only in the form of a
RedHat package from <a href="http://www.mesa3d.org/downloads/sgi.html">
http://www.mesa3d.org/downloads/sgi.html</a>. You should
download this package and convert it to whatever distribution you are
on using "alien".

Why is my CPU usage at 100% when I use a program running EVAS?
@:news_body@
When used in software mode, EVAS will use a lot of CPU. In hardware
mode however it depends on your OpenGL drivers. What a lot of drivers
do is limit buffer buffer swaps to vertical blanking gaps only. This
means that the buffers wont be swapped until the vertical blanking gap
is reached, however since there is no method of using interrupts under
Linux/X the GL drivers have to poll in a tight loop waiting for the gap.
Also if the GL libraries are accessing the GFX hardware directory then if the
hardware is busy then the app will sit and poll registers until the
hardware is ready. It's basically down to your OpenGL drivers. It's worth
noting as well that your CPU will be high whenever you run evas_test as
it is pushing your system to try and achieve the highest frame rate it
can, a situation that most software using EVAS will never be in.
