What is the  Enlightenment Window Manager?
@:news_body@
Enlightenment is a window manager for <a href="http://www.xfree86.org">X</a>.
Its design goal is to be as configurable as possible - in look AND in feel.
Enlightenment's current design aim is to become a desktop shell. That
means it will manage your application windows, being able to launch
applications, and also manage your files.
@:news_end@

@:news_title@
What are the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL)?  
@:news_body@
The Enlightenment Project is known for its window manager, but even more powerful
are the tools used to build that window manager.  Enlightenment DR15 and DR16 were
based around the Imlib library created by Rasterman to provide greater flexibility,
speed and functionality over the conventional image libraries of the time.  As the
window manager has grown, so has its need for more powerful libraries to draw on.
In DR17s development cycle more than 14 libraries have been created, and 9 are 
currently grouped together to form the basis of the applications and window manager
itself.  We collectively call these libraries "The Enlightenment Foundation Libraries"
(or EFL) to distinguish them from the window manager itself.  The core libraries
of the EFL are: EVAS, Imlib2, Ecore, EWD, Edb, EET, Estyle, Etox, and EWL.
@:news_end@

@:news_title@
Why hasn't Enlightenment had a new release in 3 years!?!
@:news_body@
<p>
The current stable release of the window manager is DR16.5, which was released to the world on 
Oct 27th 2000.  At that time work was already well underway toward DR17, Imlib2 1.0 was released
on Oct 16th 2000 and EVAS v0.0.1 was released on Oct 24th 2000.  Since that time the EFL has
grown into a mature suite of libraries which are now capable of supporting the applications and
window manager for Enlightenments DR17 release.  In the interim we saw a lot of people and code come
and go.  GEVAS was a created to use EVAS with GTK, Eprog simplified EVAS, Ebits became the themeing
and interface library for E applications, Etcher and Ebony were created as tools for creating Ebit themes
and backgrounds, EFSD was written to support the file management for E which grew out of a prototype (EFM)
that worked with DR16, not to mention an advanced prototype of the window manager itself!  But as
the code matured and we moved closer to what we wanted DR17 to become it became clear that many of
the components had already been pushed beyond their initial design and it was clear that they would need
to be replaced.  The debates raged on whether to release what was there or start rewriting 
in order to get things done right the first time.  As it should be, Raster decided he would not release
code that would just need to be immediately replaced and that we'd need to get it right.  And so
EVAS 0.6.0 gave way to a rewrite known for a short time as EVAS2, later renamed back to EVAS 1.0.  Ebits
gave way to it's rewrite renamed to Edje, which meant that applications using Ebits were no longer needed (Etcher and
Ebony).  EET was developed to more efficiently handle many of the tasks Edb was being used for, namely
packing theme data and images.  And other libraries such as EWL and Etox went along for the ride evolving
with EVAS.  Ecore was built to tie everything together and thus displaced Eprog.  And now that the
back end is now roughly where it should be work on the replacement for the window manager can occur.
</p>

<p>
We know it has been a long frustrating wait for users and we appreciate everyones patience.  Enlightenment
has a long proud history of producing the best ahead-of-it's-time eye-candy on the planet that is emulated
for years to come, and we have no desire to release a half assed product just to make people happy for 2 or 3
days until they start complaining.  The results will be well worth the wait.  And if you're a developer
there are plenty of toys for you to play with now.  If you aren't a developer you'll find no better or more
inviting place to start learning than with the EFL.  The work being done to make the next generation of the Enlightenment
Window Manager will bring a lot more than just some pretty borders around your Eterm, it will drive
the development of graphical applications industry wide for several years to come.

@:news_end@

@:news_title@
Is the EFL portable?
@:news_body@
Extremely!  Primary development of the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries is currently 
being done on Linux/X86.  Other platforms that are currently in use for development
include Linux/PPC, Linux/Sparc, Solaris/Sparc, FreeBSD, and OSX.  PDAs can use the EFL
on Qtopia (Zaurus) and most iPaq Linux distributions.  
@:news_end@

@:news_title@
What is the difference between E 17 and DR17 or 0.17?  What does DR mean?
@:news_body@
DR stands for Development Release.  The current stable window manager can be called
any of the following, E 0.16.5, E 16.5 or DR16.5 it's all the same thing.  Which you
use is a matter of personal preference.
@:news_end@

@:news_title@
I'd like to contribute! How can I commit code?
@:news_body@
Send patches! If they're good you'll get a CVS account.
@:news_end@

@:news_title@
I'd like to contribute! But I don't code!
@:news_body@
We can always use a hand.  Create themes or backgrounds, write documention or tutorials, and 
help others around you and on IRC.  If you've always wanted to code, the EFL will make it
easy for you, so start learning and share your experience with others in the form of a tutorial.

<h3>Enlightenment DR16</h3>

@:news_title@
Do people still use DR16?  
@:news_body@
Yes!  Hundreds of people use DR16 daily, possibly thousands.  As more and more users 
move to Linux and other UNIX platforms they are becoming aware of Enlightenment and making
it their window manager of choice.  As KDE and GNOME pick up more and more steam it becomes
harder to find a powerful, yet elegant window manager for the power user who wants simplicity,
flexibility and functionality.  Enlightenment is often emulated, but never duplicated.
Many of the users who have left E for Fluxbox or Sawfish have eventually come back to the frey.
@:news_end@

@:news_title@
I'm tired of the old themes!  Isn't there anything new?
@:news_body@
The Enlightenment Project currently has 2 <a href="team.html">team themers</a> who have been providing 
new <b>original</b> themes for DR16.  <a href="http://pixelhead.lostmypants.net/">Pixelhead</a> 
and <a href="http://tokyo.cored.org/">Tokyo</a>.  Both have been creating themes that will make your friends
who stopped using E a long time ago drool with envy.  Enlightenment is still the king of the eye-candy universe.
@:news_end@

@:news_title@
Is there a manual or HOWTO on building themes?
@:news_body@
Yes, a basic set of documents can be found thanks to Tokyo and the 
<a href="www.etherdoxproject.org">EtherDox Project</a> setup by Peter "monkiboi" Watts.
Pixelhead has also written a document on 
<a href="http://pixelhead.lostmypants.net/dr16borders.html">creating DR16 borders</a> that is very good.
Besides these the best way to learn is to unpack an etheme (its just a gziped tarball) and
look at how its setup.  (This is also why 90% of the themes look alike.)
@:news_end@

@:news_title@
How do I install themes?
@:news_body@
Copy the .etheme file to your $HOME/.enlightenment/themes/ directory and restart E.
@:news_end@

@:news_title@
I downloaded a theme from Freshmeat but its a tar.gz not an etheme, and I'm not sure what do to.
@:news_body@
We're not exactly sure why, but Freshmeat renames (theme).etheme's to (theme).tar.gz or (theme).tgz.
In most cases you simply need to rename the file from XXX.tgz to XXX.etheme and copy it into your 
themes directory.  There are one or two themes out there that actually are distributed as tarballs because
they require special fonts, so when you untar those themes you should get an etheme, a font, and possibly a README.
If you unpack and get a directory named after the theme then just rename it.
@:news_end@


@:news_title@
What platforms does E DR16 run on?
@:news_body@
The primary development platform is Linux.  Binaries exist for Solaris/SPARC,
AIX, *BSD, IRIX, and GNU Darwin.  Other tested platforms include: Tru64, HP-UX,
and OS/2.
@:news_end@

@:news_title@
Is DR16 still in development?
@:news_body@
Yes!  DR16 went thru a long hibernation as it's developers devoted all their
efforts toward DR17.  While there was still room for improvement in
DR16 the primary focus shifted and DR16 was left without an owner or maintainer.
Patches were commited from time to time, but it wasn't until the first half
of 2003 that Kim Woelders (kwo) took up the call to become the DR16 owner and 
began devoting time to working on improvements and bug fixes.  DR16.6 was released
Nov 5th 2003 and development on this series continues.
@:news_end@

@:news_title@
Where can I submit a patch for DR16?
@:news_body@
Send it to <a href="team.html">kwo</a>.  Make sure you have the latest version of
the code before submiting your patch to ensure someone hasn't beaten you to it.
@:news_end@

@:news_title@
Can I get rid of that bar at the top of my screen?
@:news_body@
Yes, it's called a drag bar and allows you to drag from one desktop to another without using the pager.
You can disable it on the "Special FX Settings" dialog by unchecking "Display desktop dragbar".
@:news_end@


@:news_title@
Are there tools that can help me customize E?  How can I setup key bindings?
@:news_body@
Yes, there are 2 apps that can be found <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2">
in the SourceForge files area</a> to help. E16KeyEdit for editing E key bindings and E16MenuEdit
which is a nice GTK menu editor.  Note that the tool E-Conf is no longer supported or available.
@:news_end@

@:news_title@
How do I add new backgrounds?
@:news_body@
Simply copy the new background into your $HOME/.enlightenment/backgrounds/ directory.
Any subdirectories under the backgrounds directory will show up in the Backgrounds menu as
a new sub-menu.
@:news_end@

@:news_title@
How do I add new programs to the "User Applications List" menu?
@:news_body@
Edit the file $HOME/.enlightenment/user_apps.menu and add your program on a new line
in the following form: "Program Name" NULL exec "command --arg1 --arg2"
@:news_end@

@:news_title@
How can I add a new user menu?
@:news_body@
Edit the file $HOME/.enlightenment/file.menu and add a new menu using the form:
"Menu Name" NULL menu "menu_name.menu".  Now create a menu file using the name
you chose using the same format as the the user_apps.menu.  Menus can have 
sub-menus using the same method as in the file.menu.  The first line
of each menu file will serve as the name of the menu.
@:news_end@

@:news_title@
I added a new menu item that uses quotes and my program doesn't seem to execute properly.
@:news_body@
You will need to alternate double and single quotes (ie: "command -arg 'my arg'") or if you
still have problems wrap the command in a shell script and execute the shell script instead.
@:news_end@

@:news_title@
Where can I get epplets?  How can I write my own?
@:news_body@
You can find the source package and RPMs on <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2">
the SourceForge files page</a>.  The best way to learn how to write new Epplets is 
to crack open the source and take a peak, they are pretty simple to write.
@:news_end@

@:news_title@
My epplets keep multiplying whenever I launch E. Help!
@:news_body@
That's a bug in the Epplet library. For the adventurous, you need to
remove all bogus epplet entries from
~/.enlightenment/...e_session-XXXXXX.snapshots.0 while E isn't
running. A more radical approach is to simply delete this file --
this may cause other settings to be lost, such as those for the
icon box and the pagers.  An even better method proposed by digitalfallout
is to use the following sed line to clean up the dups and make a backup:
sed -i.bak -e '/[0-9]\.Epplet$/,/^CMD:/d' .enlightenment/...e_session-XXXXXX.snapshots.0
@:news_end@

@:news_title@
Why can't E remember my desktop when I exit? 
@:news_body@
E is not, and does not contain or use, a session manager.  If you want this type of 
functionality you can use an external session manager to do it for you.  Popular session
managers include xsm (check the man page), and
<a href="http://rox.sourceforge.net/rox_session.html">ROX-Session</a>.
@:news_end@

@:news_title@
How can I get icons and file management in DR16?
@:news_body@
You need to use an external tool, Enlightenment does not support this
type of functionality in DR16.  A popular choice is <a href="http://rox.sourceforge.net/">
The ROX Desktop</a> which can run ontop of Enlightenment.  When supported, you 
can also use GNOME and KDE on top of E.
@:news_end@

@:news_title@
I'm not sure how to use all of E's features, how can I learn?
@:news_body@
On the main drop down menu (middle-click) choose help and read thru all the pages
to learn all the diffrent ways you can utilize E more efficiently.  Also, if tooltips
aren't enabled (the clouds when you don't move your mouse)  you can enable them
in the Settings menu by choosing "Tooltip Settings...".

<h3>Enlightenment DR17</h3>

@:news_title@
When will E 17 be released?
@:news_body@
The release date for E17 is sometime in the distant future; a date
unknown yet even to the developers themselves. The release day in fact will 
probably be something that just happens one day and not something in
anyway planned.
@:news_end@

@:news_title@
What exactly do you mean by "E 17 will become a desktop shell?"
@:news_body@
It means that E 17 combines features of a window manager and a file manager.
It will provide nicely integrated GUI elements for managing your desktop
elements, both files and windows. It does *not* mean that E 17 is another
application framework like Gnome and KDE.
@:news_end@

@:news_title@
Will E 16's themes work with E 17?
@:news_body@
No. The theme formats are totally different.  
@:news_end@

@:news_title@
Will the epplets in E16 work under E17?
@:news_body@
No. The API for epplets under E17 will be completely different and
therefore old epplets will not work.
@:news_end@

<h3>EFSD</h3>

@:news_title@
I heard Efsd needs FAM. What's that? What's Imon?
@:news_body@
FAM is the File Alteration Monitor, a server which reports
file modification events to clients. Imon is a Linux kernel patch
to improve performance, using it is highly recommended.
Without Imon, FAM can run in polling mode, but performance is slower.
Read more about it at <a href="http://oss.sgi.com/projects/fam">SGI</a>.
@:news_end@

@:news_title@
Can I run Efsd without FAM? Do I need Imon?
@:news_body@
At the moment, FAM is necessary to run Efsd. Imon is not required in
order to use FAM/Efsd, but is recommended. You can get
both FAM and Imon at <a href="http://oss.sgi.com/projects/fam">SGI</a>. If the
server is down, we have a local copy of FAM's sources up on our
SourceForge <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2">files page</a>.
This version also fixes an annoying compilation bug.
@:news_end@

@:news_title@
I can't compile FAM. It dies with a "`NULL' undeclared (first use this function)" message.
@:news_body@
Add the line "#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;" to BTree.h. Alternatively, you can download
our copy which has this problem fixed on our SourceForge
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2">files page</a>.
@:news_end@

@:news_title@
Why don't you add support for browsing FTP, Tarballs etc to Efsd?
@:news_body@
Because that's not Efsd's job. Efsd's job is to provide a facility
for launching file system commands and asynchronously receiving replies *on
top* of the file system, not to extend it.
@:news_end@

<h3>Evas</h3>

@:news_title@
<a name="a"></a>
Why is Evas faster with software acceleration than than when I run it
with hardware acceleration switched on?
@:news_body@
When run with hardware acceleration Evas uses the GL libraries on your
system; this means that if you have Mesa installed then Evas will use
the Mesa GL liberties. Mesa however only provides software acceleration
and therefore will run slow compared to Evas's built-in software mode. If
you have a video card that supports hardware acceleration then you should
attempt to get the manufacturers own GL drivers for your computer and
install them making sure that none of the Mesa libraries are left behind
and that where needed symbolic links are made to the real drivers.
@:news_end@

@:news_title@
<a name="b"></a>
Why is 'program x' which uses Evas so slow?
@:news_body@
See last question. The chance is that the program is trying to use
hardware acceleration by default and that you have Mesa GL libraries
installed on your system. If you don't have acceleration on your video
card then you should search for a way to switch to software acceleration
in the program.
@:news_end@

@:news_title@
<a name="c"></a>
Is there a packaged version of SGI's GLU Implementation for my computer
anywhere?
@:news_body@
At present SGI's GLU Implementation is available only in the form of a
RedHat package from <a href="http://www.mesa3d.org/downloads/sgi.html">
http://www.mesa3d.org/downloads/sgi.html</a>. You should
download this package and convert it to whatever distribution you are
on using "alien".
@:news_end@

@:news_title@
<a name="d"></a>
Why is my CPU usage at 100% when I use a program running Evas?
@:news_body@
When used in software mode, Evas will use a lot of CPU. In hardware
mode however it depends on your OpenGL drivers. What a lot of drivers
do is limit buffer swaps to vertical blanking gaps only. This
means that the buffers won't be swapped until the vertical blanking gap
is reached, however since there is no method of using interrupts under
Linux/X the GL drivers have to poll in a tight loop waiting for the gap.
Also if the GL libraries are accessing the GFX hardware directory then if the
hardware is busy then the app will sit and poll registers until the
hardware is ready. It's basically down to your OpenGL drivers. It's worth
noting as well that your CPU will be high whenever you run evas_test as
it is pushing your system to try and achieve the highest frame rate it
can, a situation that most software using Evas will never be in.
