<p class="contenttitle">Enlightenment DR16</p>

<p> 
The Enlightenment Window Manager was first released in 1997 by  Carsten "Rasterman" Haitzler.
It's release revolutionized the face of desktops on UNIX platforms and beyond, featuring
a more graphically stimulating enviroment than ever previously seen on a conventional desktop.
Since that time the window manager has been emulated and has driven the graphical appeal
we see on desktops everywhere.  In 2000, the latest major release occured with the release
of DR16.0, a release that remains in heavy usage today.  In 2003 Kim "kwo" Woelders took 
over management of the DR16 codebase and released DR16.6, improving opon the window manager
and modernizing it's dependancies, and even now the DR16 window manager has a long life ahead
of itself, even after the release of DR17.

The Enlightenment DR16 Window Manager is a robust, flexable, highly configurable, graphically
rich yet unobtrusive desktop enviroment for the X11 windowing system.  It is fully themable
and easily configured.  There are a wide range of configuration options to suite any taste.
DR16 provides an innovate way of managing applications found no where else, allowing for not
only virtual desktops, but also multiple desktops (a seperate set of virtual desktops).
A unique snapshoting pager allows for easy management of application placement and even will
zoom on on mouse-over of a window in the pager for easily locating applications.  Support
exists for up to 32 multiple desktops, and virtual desktops up to 8x8 in size! (Thats 2048 possible
desktops!)  Standard options such as focus settings and autoraise are extremely configurable
to fit your individual tastes.  Several diffrent types of move and resize effects exist, including
Opaque, Technical, Box, Shaded, Semi-solid, and Translucent, depending on your preference and CPU
requirements.  "Remember" settings can be assigned to each window allowing it to be placed
and configured just as you want on each startup of the window manager without having to edit
any files.  Windows can be individually configured to meet any desire, to change stacking
payers, border styles, window size, grouping, tab skip, stickiness, and more.  
And EESH, the Enlightenment Shell, allows for complete remote control of the window manager 
and easy scripting.

The menu system is flexable, providing easy access to applications, theme selection, 
documentation, settings, and background selection.  DR16 uniquely allows background
selection to be done from the main menu system using thumbnailed views of the background
providing a quick and easy way to change wallpaper.  In addition, desktop "FX" exist
that can add a unique flare, including a ripple effect at the base of your desktop.

A simple group of flat text files allow for easy editing of user appliation menus, including
the ability to create hierarchical user menus to suite your various needs.  At first startup
DR16 will even scan for your KDE and GNOME menus to add an application menu for them.

<p>
Standard mouseless features such as tab switching exist, but we've built on even more than that.
Virtual desktops can be navigated using the keyboard arrow keys and nearly anything including
application launching can be keybound via e16bindings making DR16 an excellent choice for
users who want a graphically rich enviroment that doesn't require constant intervention of the
mouse.

<p>
A built in help system called "eDox" provides an excellent resource for learning the wide
variety of diffrent methods of interaction and configuration.  Graphical Tool Tips can also 
be enabled to assist normal usage.

<p>
Enlightenment DR16 integrates well with both GNOME and KDE.  Replace the default window mangers
for each with Enlightenment and you'll have the power to leverage the best of GNOME and KDE at the
same time, while enjoying the superior windowing interface that Enlightenment provides.
