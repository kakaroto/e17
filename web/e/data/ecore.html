<p>What is Ecore? It is the core event abstraction layer and X abstraction
layer that makes doing selections, Xdnd, general X stuff, and event loops,
timeouts and idle handlers fast, optimized, and convenient. It's a separate
library so anyone can make use of the work put into Ecore to make this job
easy for applications.
</p>

<p>
Ecore is completely modular.  At it's base is the event handlers and timers, and initialization
and shutdown functions.  The abstraction modules for Ecore include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ecore X 
<li>Ecore FB
<li>Ecore EVAS
<li>Ecore TXT 
<li>Ecore Job
<li>Ecore IPC
<li>Ecore Con
<li>Ecore Config
</ul>


<p>
Ecore's most popular use is to answer the plee "Just give me a damned canvas!"
Here is an example of Ecore's EVAS module being used to simplify all
the setup needed to create an X11 EVAS:
</p>

<div class="code">
<pre>
#include &lt;Ecore_Evas.h&gt;
                                
#define WIDTH 200               
#define HEIGHT 200              
                                
        Ecore_Evas  *   ee;     
        Evas        *   evas;   
        Evas_Object *   base_rect;

int main(int argc, char **argv){
        
</pre>
<font color="red">
<pre>
        ecore_init();

   ee = ecore_evas_software_x11_new(NULL, 0,  0, 0, WIDTH, HEIGHT);
        ecore_evas_title_set(ee, "Ecore Template");
        ecore_evas_borderless_set(ee, 0);
        ecore_evas_show(ee);

   evas = ecore_evas_get(ee);
</pre>
</font>
<pre>
        evas_font_path_append(evas, "data/");


   base_rect = evas_object_rectangle_add(evas);
        evas_object_resize(base_rect, (double)WIDTH, (double)HEIGHT);
        evas_object_color_set(base_rect, 244, 243, 242, 255);
        evas_object_show(base_rect);

	/* More code here... */

        ecore_main_loop_begin();

        return 0;
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Ecore is so modular and powerful that it can be extremely useful even in non-graphics
programing by itself.  As an example, several web servers have been written that
were based solely on Ecore and the Ecore_Con module that abstracts socket communication.
For more information on Ecore and it's modules, please refer the the documentation.
