<p class="contenttitle">CVS Development Sources</p>

<p>All of Enlightenment's development occurs in CVS. You can
pull the code directly from CVS using the following commands: </p>

<pre>
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@@cvs.enlightenment.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/enlightenment login
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@@cvs.enlightenment.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/enlightenment co <em>modulename</em>
</pre>

<p>Use the following as module names:</p>

<table class="content" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" width="60%">
<tr><td class="newstitle">Module name</td><td class="newstitle">Content</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td>e17</td><td>E 17's <a href="components.html">components</a> <a href="cvsnotes.html">[Build Notes]</a></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" class="team-dark"><td>e16</td><td>E 16's sources</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td>eterm</td><td>Eterm's sources</td></tr>
<tr valign="top" class="team-dark"><td>misc</td><td>Miscellaneous tools</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td>web</td><td>The website</td></tr>
</table>

<p>For those without direct access to CVS (due to company firewalls or
whatever) there are some other options for fetching the source code:</p>

<p><b>Browse the CVS repository online</b></p>
<p><a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/enlightenment/">http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/enlightenment/</a></p>
<p>The entire CVS repository (including version history) is available and can
be browsed via the web. Admire the pretty colours and syntax highlighting.</p>

<p><b>Unofficial E-CVS module tarballs</b></p>
<p><a href="http://ftp.neep.com.au/pub/snapshots/cvs.enlightenment.sourceforge.net/">http://ftp.neep.com.au/pub/snapshots/cvs.enlightenment.sourceforge.net/</a> (HTTP)</p>
<p><a href="ftp://ftp.neep.com.au/pub/neep/pub/snapshots/cvs.enlightenment.sourceforge.net/">ftp://ftp.neep.com.au/pub/neep/pub/snapshots/cvs.enlightenment.sourceforge.net</a> (FTP)</p>
<p>Weekly snapshots of all the modules are available from Neep Consulting's web
and FTP sites. Andrew tries to keep the collection vaguely up to date. As of
August '01 the tarballs total about 36MB. Contact Andrew Shugg via the "Team"
page if you have any enquiries or problems with these; this is not a supported
service by the E developers.</p>

<p><b>SourceForge CVS repository tarball</b></p>
<p><a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cvstarballs/enlightenment-cvsroot.tar.gz">http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cvstarballs/enlightenment-cvsroot.tar.gz</a></p>
<p>Warning: this is SourceForge's nightly tarball (or daily snapshot - the
nomenclature is inconsistent) of the <em>entire repository</em>. That means full
CVS history on every file, Attic, the lot; it's a complete backup.  As of August
'01 the enlightenment-cvsroot.tar.gz file weighs in at 200MB and is only going
to get bigger with time. Not recommended for the faint of heart.</p>
<p>If you download this and create your own local E CVS repository you would be
advised to hack up some procmail script to grab diffs from the enlightenment-cvs
mailing list as the main repository is updated. For new files and directories
you'll probably have to manually get them using the web interface below. Again,
this course of action is not for the faint of heart. =)</p>

<p>Our CVS repository is hosted by the good boys and girls at 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a>.  You can get more info
about using their CVS servers in their 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=763&amp;group_id=1">SourceForge CVS HOWTO</a>.</p>
