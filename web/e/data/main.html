<p class="contenttitle">Welcome to the Enlightenment Project!</p>

<p>Enlightenment is a completely themeable, highly configurable Window
Manager for the <a href="http://www.x.org/">X Window System</a>,
traditionally used in Unix environments.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="img/ruler.gif" height="1" width="200" /></p>

<p>The current, stable release of Enlightenment is 0.16.5. A feature
list is available <a href="features-0.16.html">here</a>, documentation
is <a href="docs.html">here</a>.
<p>The development effort for the 0.17 series is well underway and
a lot larger than for the 0.16 series, mainly because Enlightenment is
going to become a desktop shell. See the <a href="faq.html">FAQs</a>
to find out what this means and what not. The subsystems created along
the way for purposes of graphics handling, filesystem access etc are
organized in standalone libraries that can be used by other projects
as well.

Therfore, this site includes information about the
<a href="evas.html">Enlightenment Canvas Library (Evas)</a>, the imaging
library <a href="imlib2.html">Imlib2</a>,
the <a href="efsd.html">Enlightenment File System Daemon (EFSD)</a>, and 
the other <a href="components.html">components</a> of the Enlightenment
desktop shell.

<p>Currently, for support, you have three options: using irc (preferred; #e on
irc.openprojects.net), our
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=2">mailing lists</a>,
or email (use email addresses from the
<a href="team.html">team page</a>, but don't bug Raster if you don't need to).
Suggestions are welcome.</p>
