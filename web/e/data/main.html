<p class="contenttitle">Welcome to the Enlightenment Project!</p>

<p>Enlightenment is a Window Manager for the
<a href="http://www.x.org/">X Window System</a>, traditionally used in
Unix environments. On this site you'll find information about both the current release of Enlightenment
and what's happening regarding the development version, including
the <a href="evas.html">Enlightenment Canvas Library (Evas)</a>, the imaging library <a href="imlib2.html">Imlib2</a>,
the <a href="efsd.html">Enlightenment File System Daemon (EFSD)</a>, and 
the other <a href="components.html">components</a> of the Enlightenment desktop shell.
If you want to jump right in, you can download everything you need <a href="download.html">here</a>.

<p>Currently, for support, you have three options: using irc (preferred; #e on
irc.openprojects.net), our
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=2">mailing lists</a>,
or email (use email addresses from the
<a href="team.html">team page</a>, but don't bug Raster if you don't need to).
Suggestions are welcome.</p>
