<p class="contenttitle">Welcome to the Enlightenment Project!</p>

<p>For the End User Enlightenment is a Window Manager for the
<a href="http://www.x.org/">X Window System</a>, traditionally used in
Unix environments.   But for the Developer Enlightenment means alot more.
The developers behind Enlightenment are some of the brightest and most innovative
in the world of <a href="http://www.opensource.org/">Open</a> <a href="http://www.gnu.org">Source</a> 
development.  While the Window Manager is famous for being one of the most powerful
and <b>flexable</b> Window Mangers avalible, so are the tools used to build it.
On this site you'll find information about the Window Manger itself, about
the <a href="evas.html">E Canvas Library (Evas)</a>, the <a href="imlib2.html">Enlightened Imaging 
Library (imlib2)</a>, the <a href="efsd.html">Enlightened File System Daemon (EFSD)</a>, and 
<a href="components.html">far far more</a>.  The project always has and always
shall be a driving force in Open Source desktops in or outside of the Window Manager itself.

<a href="team.html">team page</a>, but don't bug raster if you don't need to).
Suggestions are welcome.</p>
