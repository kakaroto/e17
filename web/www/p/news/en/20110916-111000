Dear Enlightened people of the world,
</p>

<p>
We are happy to announce that we have started working on a native port
of the EFL for the Playstation 3 system.
</p>

<p>
This port comes as great news for the ps3 homebrew community which has
been strugling with a complete lack of tools for easily developing
application. With PSL1GHT (The unofficial PS3 SDK) and a port of the
SDL as pretty much the only available libraries for the PS3, not much
could be done without a huge waste of time in order to reimplement all
the basic things.
</p>

<p>
The initial port of the EFL was done in just a couple of days, where
eina, eet, evas, ecore, embryo and edje were made available and a port
of expedite and eskiss were successfully running on the PS3.The port
was made using the SDL engine for evas, and while it worked, the
performance wasn't great.
</p>

<p>
Work has continued since then and a new psl1ght engine was added to
evas which makes use of PSL1GHT's capabilities for setting up the
display. For now, it is still a work in progress and the rendering is
still done in software, but we plan on making the engine fully
hardware accelerated to take advantage of the powerful capabilities of
the Playstation 3 console. The engine now has mouse and keyboard
support as well as mouse emulation using the PS3 controller.
</p>

<p>
Elementary, the EFL widget toolkit has also been partially ported and
this means that all of the widgets that elementary provides can be
used in applications, this should make development of any kind of
homebrew application much easier, whether it be for an alternative PS
Store, or for in game menus. Edje, the powerful layout engine, will
also allow developers to write themeable applications, or games, with
nice animations and all the eye candy they need.
</p>

<p>
On a side note, this work also means that the EFL will soon have
joystick support added into evas, ecore and ecore-input, and this will
hopefully bring us tons of new EFL-based games and apps for the PC as
well.
</p>

<p>
A thank you goes to KaKaRoTo, zerkman and gzorin for their work in
making this possible.

<p>
We will keep you informed of any progress on this area, for now here
is a quick TODO list for what's to come :
<ul>
<li>hardware accelerated rendering</li>
<li>full joystick support</li>
<li>support for the Move controller</li>
<li>full support of Elementary and all of its widgets</li>
<li>More apps and games ported</li>
</ul>
