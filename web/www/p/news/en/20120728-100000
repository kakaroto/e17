We're growing and moving and it's time we had a conference of our own. So here comes the first ever EFL Developer Day. We have decided to co-locate the event alongside <a href=http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/linuxcon-europe>LinuxCon Europe</a> which is also running alongside ELC Europe, the KVM Forum, Gluster workshop, Yocto Project Developer Day and Wireless Mini Summit. It will be held on the 5th of November at the <a href=http://www.fira-palace.com/>Hotel Fira Palace</a> in Barcelona, Spain. Plan your travel today and join in on the fun and excitement.

We're already planning a fully packed day of presentations, panels and more, so stay tuned for more information on this in the coming weeks.
