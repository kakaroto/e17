The snapshot release of Eina, Evas, Ecore, Embryo, Edje, E_Dbus, Efreet and
Enlightenment includes lots of improvements and fixes. Too many to put here,
but these are not considered stable yet, and thus we don't track changelogs.
They do impose soname changes and module versioning now to make packaging
cleaner alongside svn source installs. Please download, try and test these.
