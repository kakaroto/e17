Enlightenment DR17 (or E17 for short) is being actively developed for the last three years.</p><p>
We are using CVS for our repository, so one of the ways to get E is to download it directly from the repository, as it is explaned <a href='http://web.enlightenment.org/p.php?p=download/cvs&l=en'>here</a>. Although we are trying to keep the code there stable and usable, there is still chance to get it in a bad moment when it is broken. So, for the users who would prefer more stable (but older) E,there are development snapshots.</p><p> 
Development snapshots are packages (archives) with E17's and it's core librariescode inside. They are being created regulary, usualy when some new features madeand, of course when everything is "stable". Yet, you need to keep in mind that theese are not official releases and E is still in pre-alpha version. This means,that it still have many bugs and some of the features are not implemented yet. The snapshots are currently hosted <a href='http://enlightenment.freedesktop.org/'>here</a>.</p><p>
Another (and maybe the most preferable by users) way to have E on your computer is to use packages made for their operating systems or Linux distributions.
There are unofficial packages for most distributions, including Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, ArchLinux, Gentoo, and so on. There are ports for E17 and EFL in FreeBSD's port collection. And again, there is no guarantee that those packages will work. If you experience any problems with E using the packages, please first reffer to the packager(s), not to the E17 team.

FIXME: should the scripts for getting/installing E go here on in the CVS page?
