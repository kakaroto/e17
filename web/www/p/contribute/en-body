 <h2>Source</h2>
 
 <p>
  All our source code is available from our SVN source repository at
  all times. If we actually are moving seriously on a piece of code,
  it will make its way to our <?php a("download", "download");?> page.
  For something supported, look there. If you want to help with
  development or are just hyper-curious and want to see what's in our
  workshop, then you will want to <a
  href=http://trac.enlightenment.org/e/browser/trunk>browse through
  our SVN repository</a>. Alternatively, you will want to check it out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our SVN repository is not small. There's currently over 1.5 million
  lines of C source code alone in there. Along with some other
  languages. A full local checkout will use about 1.2 GB of local disk
  space. To check it out you will need <a 
  href=http://subversion.tigris.org/>subversion</a>. Most Linux
  distributions come with packages for them. For other operating
  systems your luck may vary. There is <a
  href=http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/>Tortoise SVN</a> for windows,
  and OSX users can just use regular subversion like their Linux
  counterparts. To check out all of SVN just use:
 </p>
<p><pre><code>svn co http://svn.enlightenment.org/svn/e
</code></pre></p>
 <p>
  <em>(You can also use https instead of http if you want to use SSL
  encryption)</em>
 </p>
 <p>
  You can also use git (with git-svn) if you want to maintain lots of
  local branches, code and features and generate patches and so on. You
  can do this with:
 </p>
<p><pre><code>git svn clone http://svn.enlightenment.org/svn/e
</code></pre></p>
 <p>
  You can alternatively download the git-svn tars from <a href=http://download.enlightenment.org/git_svn>here</a>
  and use them instead; This alternative is significantly faster.
 <p>
  To update the code in your tree (pull in changes from our master
  tree), just use:
 </p>
<p><pre><code>svn update
</code></pre></p>
 <p>
  Or for git use:
 </p>
<p><pre><code>git svn rebase
</code></pre></p>
 <p>
  If you have made changes you'd like to share, you can generate a patch
  file from your changes with:
 </p>
<p><pre><code>svn diff
</code></pre></p>
 <p>
  Or with git
 </p>
<p><pre><code>git diff
</code></pre></p>
 <p>
  Please read the appropriate manuals for your chosen revisioning
  system so you know how to use it effectively.
 </p>
  <hr>
 <p>
  Once you become an enlightenment developer, you will possibly get SVN
  commit access. This means you can not just fetch the code and generate
  patches, but you can also directly put changes into SVN (commit them).
  All changes are watched and broadcast on our
  <a href=https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/enlightenment-svn>
  SVN Commits List</a> as they happen. To gain a copy of the tree as a
  developer with commit access you will want to check out the tree with
 one of the following commands (depending on if you want to use SVN
  directly, or SVN via git), where <b>USER</b> is your assigned username:
 </p>
<p><pre><code>svn co svn+ssh://USER@svn.enlightenment.org/var/svn/e
</code></pre></p>
<p><pre><code>git svn clone svn+ssh://USER@svn.enlightenment.org/var/svn/e/evas
</code></pre></p>
 <p>
  You can also use the git svn tars with a developer access, you just need to
  run the <a href=http://download.enlightenment.org/git_svn/gsvn_to_developer.sh>conversion script</a> as follows:
<p><pre><code>
  ./gsvn_to_developer.sh USER MODULE
  for example:
  ./gsvn_to_developer.sh tasn evas
</code></pre></p>
 </p>
 <p>
  You can also use our git mirror server at:
 </p>
<p><pre><code>git clone git://git.enlightenment.org/git/e.git
</code></pre></p>
 <p>
  Our SVN tree is divided up and categorized. The <b>trunk</b>
  directory is where all the main development happens. Inside this
  directory most maintained source lives in the base. We divided off
  bindings for other languages off into the <b>BINDINGS</b> directory. 
  The <b>E-MODULES-EXTRA</b> contains a whole bunch of modules for
  enlightenment that may or may not work - try at your own risk.
  <b>PROTO</b> contains prototype applications. <b>TMP</b> is scratch
  space for projects yet to be categorized or found a home in the
  tree. We could go on telling you about the tree, but it's best to
  just look around and see. Just keep in mind that this tree is our
  "workshop" and parts of it may be in better condition than others and
  may or may not be usable. If you look here it is assumed you have a
  good technical grasp on things and can work out what is and isn't
  relevant or being worked on or going to be released any time soon.

 <h2>Building</h2>
 
 <p>
  Almost all our project are C based (with some C++). They almost all
  use autoconf, automake, libtool etc. (autotools) and any such source
  tree will ship with an <b>autogen.sh</b> script. This is where it all
  begins.
 </p>
 <p>
  To build a library or application simply start by running the
  <b>autogen.sh</b> script (and pass in a --prefix="/where/to/install"
  option if you wish something other than the default /usr/local install
  location). The <b>autogen.sh</b> script will run configure for you,
  passing in any parameters provided to it to configure. After this you
  should be able to do the usual <b>make</b> and <b>make install</b>
  (as root if you install in a root owned location). So a quick recipe for
  building anything would be:
 </p>
<p><pre><code>./autogen.sh &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; sudo make install</b>
</code></pre></p>
 <p>
  You will definitely want the following installed to build EFL and E
  (exact package names may vary from system to system):
 </p>
 <p>
  <ul>
   <li>subversion</li>
   <li>gcc</li>
   <li>autoconf 2.59 or better</li>
   <li>automake 1.10 or better</li>
   <li>libtool</li>
   <li>make (gnu make)</li>
   <li>gettext</li>
   <li>libpam dev headers</li>
   <li>libfreetype dev headers</li>
   <li>libpng dev headers</li>
   <li>libjpeg dev headers</li>
   <li>zlib dev headers</li>
   <li>libdbus dev headers</li>
   <li>liblua 5.1 or better dev headers</li>
   <li>libx11 dev headers</li>
   <li>libxcursor dev headers</li>
   <li>libxrender dev headers</li>
   <li>libxrandr dev headers</li>
   <li>libxfixes dev headers</li>
   <li>libxdamage dev headers</li>
   <li>libxcomposite dev headers</li>
   <li>libxss dev headers</li>
   <li>libxp dev headers</li>
   <li>libxext dev headers</li>
   <li>libxinerama dev headers</li>
   <li>libxkbfile dev headers</li>
   <li>libxtst dev headers</li>
  </ul>
 </p>
 <p>
  Some extra optional packages for support of bonus features that you
  might want installed also are:
 </p>
 <p>
  <ul>
   <li>libtiff dev headers (tiff loading support in evas)</li>
   <li>librsvg dev headers (svg loading support in evas)</li>
   <li>libungif dev headers (gif loading support in evas)</li>
   <li>libcurl dev headers (http download/fetch support in ecore)</li>
   <li>libgnutls dev headers (signed eet files, secure tcp connection support for ecore)</li>
   <li>libasound2 dev headers (alsa sound card support in E17 mixer module)</li>
  </ul>
 </p>
 <p>
  Also note that for many other libraries and applications you may
  want or need other dependencies. These will vary from project to
  project. For example - <b>emotion</b> will require either gstreamer or
  libxine libraries and development headers to build.
 </p>
 <p>
  The following handy script will also give you an insight as to how
  to compile things and in what order:
 </p>
<p><pre><code>#!/bin/sh
set -e
PREFIX="/usr/local"
PROJECTS="\
eina eet evas ecore embryo edje e_dbus efreet e"
SITE="svn.enlightenment.org"
SVN="http://$SITE/svn/e/trunk"
OPT="--prefix=$PREFIX"
svn co $SVN
PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$PREFIX/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH"
PATH="$PREFIX/bin:$PATH"
LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$PREFIX/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
for PROJ in $PROJECTS; do
  cd trunk/$PROJ
  make clean distclean || true
  ./autogen.sh $OPT
  make
  sudo make install
  cd ../..
  sudo ldconfig
done

 <h2>Conventions</h2>
 
 <p>
  We follow many conventions in order to work as a team despite the fact
  that we are spread around the world, in many different timezones, speak
  many languages, run multiple operating systems and have divergent goals.
  These conventions cover how we speak, communicate, what our code looks
  like, what our source trees look like and more. These conventions help
  our many disparate libraries at least look somewhat alike and makes
  maintenance, development and troubleshooting much easier. It also
  helps with an introduction to Enlightenment and EFL as the rules you
  learn in one place allow you to quickly discover what you need in
  another unfamiliar location, as it follows the same conventions.
 </p>
 <h3>Language</h3>
 <p>
  Our primary language is English. For better or worse it is the
  one language most of us know better than any other. All documentation,
  comments and discussion should be in English. It doesn't need to be
  perfect. It needs to be understandable. So when you write code comments,
  <?php a("contact", "discuss anything ");?> on IRC, in E-Mail or
  otherwise, please keep it in English.
 </p>
 <h3>Coding Style</h3>
 <p>
  Our golden rule of coding - <b>FOLLOW THE CODING STYLE
  ALREADY THERE</b>. That means that if you work on code that already
  exists, keep to the spacing, indenting, variable and function naming
  style, etc. that already exists. Don't go changing it mid-file or
  mid-project. It is even better if you use the same formatting for
  new projects that has already been used on others. It means the code
  is easier to read and maintain.
 </p>
<p><pre><code>static Eet_File_Node *
_eet_node_find(Eet_File   *ef,
               const char *name)
{
  Eet_File_Node *efn;
  int hash = _eet_hash_gen(name, ef->dir->size);
  
  for (efn = ef->dir->nodes[hash]; efn; efn = efn->next)
    {
      if (_eet_match(efn->name, name)) return efn;
      else break;
    }
  return NULL;
}

EAPI Eet_Error
eet_sync(Eet_File *ef)
{
  Eet_Error ret;

  if (_eet_check(ef)) return EET_ERROR_BAD;
  if ((ef->mode != EET_MODE_WRITE) &amp;&amp;
      (ef->mode != EET_MODE_READ_WRITE))
    return EET_ERROR_CANNOT_WRITE;
  else
    {
      ef->data = NULL;
      ef->count++;
    }
  ret = eet_flush(ef);
  return ret;
}
</code></pre></p>
 <h3>Source Trees</h3>
 <p>
  We use "autotools" as our build setup. For better or worse this is
  the predominant "standard" when it comes to build systems in the
  open source world. It's the devil we know and changing it is an
  uphill battle that may not actually end up in a better position
  than where we started. So it's staying, for now.
 </p>
 <p>
  The configure template file is <b>configure.ac</b>. This determines
  the package name, version, what it checks for in dependencies and
  what Makefiles are to be output in what directories. If configure
  has extra macros we place them inside the <b>m4</b> directory. Here
  you will find extra non-default autotools macros for checking of
  dependencies etc.
 </p>
 <p>
  Source is structured with source code being in the <b>src</b>
  directory tree. This in turn is split up into directories like
  <b>bin</b> (that produces binary executables), <b>lib</b> (that
  produces shared libraries for others to link to), and
  <b>modules</b> (that produces module shared objects that the
  binaries or libraries may dynamically load at runtime to add
  new features).
 </p>
 <p>
  The documentation templates and build happens in the <b>doc</b>
  directory and uses the same template style for html etc. so our
  documentation looks consistent.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the <b>data</b> directory you will find possibly many things,
  but mostly data files that get installed and then needed at runtime
  such as icons, desktop files, theme files (edj) and so on. This will
  normally be broken up into sub directories here too.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some projects have a <b>config</b> directory in which a set of default
  configuration files are set up and installed by default, maybe split
  into profiles and more.
 </p>
 <p>
  In some projects there is even a <b>win32</b> directory for
  files related to building that project on windows.
 </p>
 <h3>Licenses &amp; Copyright</h3>
 <p>
  By default we stick to open source licenses. GPL, LGPL, BSD and so
  on. The person who starts any project calls the shots on its initial
  license and it is assumed all people contributing to it do so under
  the terms of that license. We also respect the licenses of others and
  their works, so we won't be accepting code that we know is already
  under an incompatible license. All projects should contain a COPYING
  file in the base directory of that project that covers all files in
  that project (unless otherwise stated).
 </p>
 <p>
  If you want your name listed as an author of a project when you
  contribute code, <b>PLEASE</b> remember to include your name and
  E-Mail address as a patch to the AUTHORS file. This way you will have
  the correct name and contact details listed. All members of the
  AUTHORS file share copyright over the code they contribute to. So
  remember to include this change to AUTHORS for the first patch or
  commit you provide to make sure your name is immortalized in
  blinking lights in the AUTHORS file.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you want to begin work on a a feature - something that isn't just
  a small trivial fix or feature, please discuss it on our mailing lists
  or IRC channels or both. Generally try and find the person in charge
  of that component, but if you can't, a broadcast to the devel list
  should find them. At this point you should discuss your idea and
  plans. This is where you can find out if someone else is already
  doing it, if it's a good idea or not, if it can be done better, how it
  should be done etc. Once you get agreement, you will know what to do
  next. Doing work and then just dumping it on developers as a
  surprise generally doesn't get a positive response. It was unexpected
  and often quite large. If you send small patches and changes over
  many days or weeks, as opposed to wait weeks or even months then send a
  single massive patch, you will get much better response. Big patches
  discourage review as time to review it is large and most developers
  just don't have such large blocks of time. Lots of smaller steps
  always works better.

 <h2>Join us</h2>
 
 <p>
  If you join us you'll be welcomed into a community of developers and
  users who like to do cool things and actually make them happen. If
  you join you will not only be able to hang out with us (well you can
  anyway), you'll actually start to have a say in how Enlightenment and
  EFL develop, if not actually get some control. It also reduces a
  massive amount of work involved in maintaining forks as your work
  becomes mainline and gets shared, tested and maintained by a wider
  audience earlier, not to mention it likely becomes much better
  quality. If you are not into doing code, maybe you can help in other
  ways like with advertising and publicity, documentation and
  packaging, if not just regular bug reporting.
 </p>
 <p>
  To report a bug please see the <?php a("contact", "contact");?> page.
  To submit initial patches for code, please send them to the mailing
  list after discussions have taken place. Keep patches small and send
  them, often as you work. Small patches get reviewed quickly. Large
  patches get delayed or sometimes ignored or lost. Make sure that any
  patch at least compiles and doesn't break an existing functionality
  (so make the changes enableable at compile or runtime as part of the
  patch if it does intersect with existing functionality). You will get
  feedback on your patches and may be asked to make changes before
  inclusion. Also remember to respect the formatting and conventions of
  the existing code as it gets a bit tedious asking for basic changes
  like naming, spacing and general style. We'd rather focus on the
  actual algorithms and features involved.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you want developer access (SVN commit access) first you will need
  an existing developer to approve that. Generally any senior or long
  time developer can do it - new ones can too but will probably defer
  the OK decision to a senior developer first. To gain access we need
  you to provide a few files. The kind of files you find like
  <a href=http://trac.enlightenment.org/e/browser/trunk/devs/raster>
  this developer</a>.
 </p>
 <p>
  The <b>info.txt</b> file provides general information about you.
  Please fill one in with relevant information needed, with your Login
  being the developer login name you'd like, as well as other important
  fields. If you are new the Managing and Contributing fields may be
  empty, as well as Group, but please provide everything else including
  your location in the world as well as actual Geographic data.
 </p>
 <p>
  The <b>id_rsa.pub</b> is your SSH public key. You will find this in
  your <b>~/.ssh</b> directory. If you don't have one yet, you can
  generate one with: 
 </p>
<p><pre><code>ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
</code></pre></p>
 <p>
  for example. You should read the SSH manuals for more information if
  you need it. This SSH key will give you access to SVN so you can
  check out and commit code, with all traffic between you and
  enlightenment.org being encrypted.
 </p>
 <p>
  As an addition we also ask you to provide some photos/images/icons
  of yourself so we can put a face to a name. Take a look at the example
  ones in the above developer directory. Provide images of the exact
  same size in pixels, with the </b>icon-map.png</b> file having an
  arrow at the bottom pointing down. This image is used on our world
  developer map.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you can't write code, you can always help by writing
  documentation or articles or blogs. Contributing content to our
  wiki site that may help other users is always useful. We also always
  can do with artwork and graphics people. People who do artwork would
  be able to get developer access as they will need access to the
  source trees so they can put their artwork in there anyway. We also
  can always do with people helping translate things. We use gettext
  like most open source software, so it's as simple as providing us with
  new or updated .PO files. We even have
  <a href=https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/enlightenment-intl>
  a dedicated mailing list</a> for just this purpose.
 </p>
 <p>
  Otherwise, debugging is also something that is always needed. No code
  is perfect. It's written by humans. But bugs need to be fixed and to
  help you help us find the bugs we don't see, but you do, see our
  <a href=http://trac.enlightenment.org/e/wiki/Debugging>debugging</a>
  page that lets you know how to begin to find bugs and provide useful
  feedback.
