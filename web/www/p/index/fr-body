<h3>What is Enlightenment?</h3>
<p>
<em>Enlightenment</em>. What is <em>Enlightenment</em>?.<br />Some people
affectionately refer to <em>Enlightenment</em> as <em>E</em> because typing
or saying the whole word is a bit of a mouthful. Early in its history, which began back in 1996, E was just a
<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_manager'>window manager</a> for
<a href='http://www.x.org'>X11</a>.
</p><p>
Since then, E has now become much more. In the process of building the next generation of
the window manager, we have created a suite of libraries for doing data
storage and retrieval, scene-graph rendering with a canvas, theme
encapsulation, compiling and demand-loading, event loop, inter-process
communication, <a href='http://www.freedesktop.org'>freedesktop.org</a>
specification handling, virtual machines, video codec abstractions, widget
sets, and more.
</p><p>
This is in addition to the window manager and utilities and apps. There is
even a prototype media center that uses the same libraries that E is being
built on, as a demonstration of how powerful the back-end is.
</p><p>
We also do not only target desktops, but also work on old systems and
embedded environments, with our libraries made to be lean and fast, so even
the most limited of systems can enjoy some eye-candy.
</p><p>

<p>
Currently <?php a("about/dev", "Enlightenment 0.17 (known as E17)");?> is
under development with a <b>TODO</b> list that is being worked on for release.
The base libraries it depends on
<?php a("about/libs", "EFL (Enlightenment Foundation Libraries)");?> are
very mature and stable. There are other applications that use these too. E17
itself is primarily available via SVN.
</p><p>
But despite this, the stable release of
<?php a("about/e16", "Enlightenment (the 0.16 series)");?> is still alive
and maintained. It is not dead and does undergo feature adds, fixes and
improvements.

<h3>News and Updates</h3>
<p>
<b>2007/04/22</b> - <em>Website update</em>
</p><p>
We have undergone a complete rennovation of this website. We have added
<a href='http://forum.enlightenment.org'>Forums</a>, a
<a href='http://bugs.enlightenment.org'>Bug tracker</a>, and a
<a href='http://wiki.enlightenment.org'>Wiki</a> too for community
documentation efforts. The main website,
<a href='http://www.enlightenment.org'>www.enlightenment.org</a> also has
been completely re-done, with all new content and layout, hopefully showing a
more useful face to the world of our development efforts.
