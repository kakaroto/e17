<p>Evas is a hardware-accelerated canvas API for X-Windows that can draw
anti-aliased text, smooth super and sub-sampled images, alpha-blend, as well
as drop down to using normal X11 primitives such as pixmaps, lines and
rectangles for speed if your CPU or graphics hardware are too slow.</p>
<p>Evas abstracts any need to know much about what the characteristics of your
XServer's display are, what depth or what magic visuals etc, it has. The
most you need to tell Evas is how many colors (at a maximum) to use if the
display is not a truecolor display. By default it is suggested to use 216
colors (as this equates to a 6x6x6 color cube - exactly the same color cube
Netscape, Mozilla, gdkrgb etc. use so colors will be shared). If Evas can't
allocate enough colors it keeps reducing the size of the color cube until it
reaches plain black and white. This way, it can display on anything from a
black and white only terminal to 16 color VGA to 256 color and all the way
up through 15, 16, 24 and 32bit color. Here are some screen shots of a demo
Evas application to show the rendering output in different situations</p>
