<p>The new Imlib library</p>

<span class="contentmain"><p>Imlib 2 is the successor to Imlib. It is not just a newer version -
    it is a completely new library. Imlib2 can be installed alongside
    Imlib 1.x without any problems since they are effectively different
    libraries - but they Have very similar functionality.</p>

<p>Imlib2 can do the following:</p>

<ul><li>Load image files from disk in one of many formats</li><li>Save images to disk in one of many formats</li><li>Render image data onto other images</li><li>Render images to an X-Windows drawable</li><li>Produce pixmaps and pixmap masks of Images</li><li>Apply filters to images</li><li>Rotate images</li><li>Accept RGBA Data for images</li><li>Scale images</li><li>Alpha blend Images on other images or drawables</li><li>Apply color correction and modification tables and factors to images</li><li>Render images onto images with color correction and modification tables</li><li>Render truetype anti-aliased text</li><li>Render truetype anti-aliased text at any angle</li><li>Render anti-aliased lines</li><li>Render rectangles</li><li>Render linear multi-colored gradients</li><li>Cache data intelligently for maximum performance</li><li>Allocate colors automatically</li><li>Allow full control over caching and color allocation</li><li>Provide highly optimized MMX assembly for core routines</li><li>Provide plug-in filter interface</li><li>Provide on-the-fly runtime plug-in image loading and saving interface</li><li>Fastest image compositing, rendering and manipulation library for X</li></ul>

<p>
If what you want isn't in the list above somewhere then likely Imlib 2
does not do it. If it does it it likely does it faster than any other
library you can find (this includes gdk-pixbuf, gdkrgb, etc.) primarily
because of highly optimized code and a smart subsystem that does the
dirty work for you and picks up the pieces for you so you can be lazy
and let all the optimizations for you.
</p>

<p>Imlib 2 can run without a display, so it can be easily used for
background image processing for web sites or servers - it only requires
the X libraries to be installed - that is all - it does not require
an XServer to run unless you wish to display images.
