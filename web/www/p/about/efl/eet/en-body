	<h1>Eet</h1>
			
	<p>Eet is primarily a data encoding, decoding and storage library. It is meant
	to be very programmer friendly, removing lots of work from loading and saving
	data held in data structures. It can store multiple chunks of data in a single
	file and random-access retrieve the data very efficiently, encode and decode
	image data and any other kind of data. Files are compact and efficient as well as
	being portable between platforms (e.g. take a file written on a 32-bit x86 system
	and move it to a 64-bit PPC system and it will "just work"). Eet is portable
	between many architectures and operating systems and can function on embedded
	systems all the way up to multi-CPU server farms.</p>
	
	<p>The result of this is a tiny (52Kb on x86-32, 56Kb on ARM4) library that
	removes a lot of the need to parse configuration, and handle storage efficiently
	as well as transport stored data to other locations without loss.</p>
	
	<p>Eet has very few requirements. On UNIX, beyond the normal libc and system
	compiling tools and headers, you will need libjpeg (also know as jpeglib) and its
	headers and build packages, as well as zlib (libz) and its headers and build
	packages.</p>
