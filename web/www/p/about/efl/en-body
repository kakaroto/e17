     <p>The Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL) are a collection of libraries that make up the foundation 
     of the DR17 window manager.  While their original intent was solely to support the window manager, the libraries
     quickly took on a life of their own, which is a contributing factor to the delays of the window manager itself.
     These libraries are so powerful, flexible, and easy to use that they present a strong platform on which to
     develop nearly any graphical application you could think of.</p>

     <p>The EFL begins with Evas, our canvas library. Because Evas is built
     on several different selectable engines (Linux FrameBuffer, DirectFB,
     X11, OpenGL/OpenGL-ES, QTopia, etc) the platform is
     extremely portable, which translates thru to all of the libraries
     built on top of it. Ecore is a modular convience library that in its
     base provides timers, callback functionality, and loop management for
     event handling. Ecore's various modules can simplify the setup of an
     X11 drawable for general use (Ecore_X11), an X11 drawable for
     use with Evas (Ecore_Evas), manage IPC (Ecore_IPC), manage BSD Sockets
     (Ecore_Con), management of the FrameBuffer (Ecore_FB), and more.
     Because Ecore can simplify so many tasks that are used in conjuction
     with Evas it has lived up to its name as the core component of nearly
     any EFL application.</p>
     
     <p>Eina centralises data structures and memory handling functions beyond
     what system "mallocs" provide.</p>

     <p>Edje provides a revolutionary method of abstracting every aspect of
     your interface from the application itself. By passing signals
     between the interface and the application all communication is done in
     an interface neutral way. No longer are &quot;themes&quot; simple changes
     of pixmaps over a fixed area. Using Embryo we can provide scripting
     ability to the interface componant itself to harness even more power
     and flexibility.</p>

     <p>Elementary ties things together in a touchscreen finger-friendly
     widget set. And there is much more.</a>

     <p>Below is a diagram of how the various components of the EFL fit together. Because
     of complexity of the libraries and the fact that so many libraries can be used
     independant of other EFL libraries we have a diagram a little more complex than
     your standard block diagram.</p>
