    <a href=http://trac.enlightenment.org/e/wiki/Enlightenment>Enlightenment</a>
    is the flagship and original name bearer for this project. Once it was
    just a humble window manager for X11 that wanted to do things differently.
    To do them better, but it has expanded. This can be confusing
    so when we refer to Enlightenment, we may mean the project as a whole or
    just the window manager proper. The libraries behind Enlightenment are
    referred to as EFL collectively, each with a specific name and purpose.
   </p>
   
   <p>
    The window manager is a lean, fast, modular and very extensible window
    manager for X11 and Linux. It is classed as a "desktop shell" providing
    the things you need to operate your desktop (or laptop), but is not a
    whole application suite. This covered launching applications, managing
    their windows and doing other system tasks like suspending, reboots,
    managing files etc.

    Enlightenment and EFL support several platforms, though Linux is the
    primary platform of choice for our developers, some make efforts to make
    things work on FreeBSD and other BSD's, Solaris, MacOS X, Windows (XP,
    Vista, 7 etc.), Windows CE and more. Compatibility will vary, but most of
    core EFL support all Linuxes, BSD's, Solaris and other UNIX-like OS's.
    Mac support should work mostly thanks to the X11 support in OS X, and
    Windows support exists for most of the core libraries (XP, Vista, 7, CE).
   </p>
   
   <p>
    Please <?php a("contact", "contact");?> us for more information if you
    have problems with support in your platform. Just remember we have limited
    resources and most of them focus on the core open-source targets.

   <h3>Proven effectiveness</h3>
   
   <p>
    Enlightenment libraries already power millions of systems, from mobile
    phones to set top boxes, desktops, laptops, game systems and more. It is
    only now being recognized for its forward-thinking approaches, as
    products and designers want to do more than the boring functional user
    experiences of the past. This is where EFL excels.
   </p>
   
   <p>
    <a href=http://www.free.fr>Free.fr</a> is shipping millions of set top
    boxes in France, powered by EFL. The 
    <a href=http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Neo_FreeRunner>Openmoko Freerunner</a>
    sold thousands of devices with EFL on them. 
    <a href=http://www.yellowdoglinux.com/>Yellow Dog Linux</a> for the Sony 
    PS3 ships with Enlightenment as the default. EFL has been used on printers,
    netbooks and more.

   <h3>Building Blocks</h3>
   
   <p>
    Enlightenment, the window manager is built on top of building blocks
    known as EFL (the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries). There are more
    than can be sensibly put into the simple block diagram above, but this
    covers the essentials.
   </p>
   
   <center>
    <?php img("diagram-efl-simple-small.png", "Simple E stack");?>
   </center>
   
   <p>
    Pretty much any application written using Core EFL libraries will use one
    or more of these depending on its needs. It may only need the lower level
    ones or use all of them to the top of the stack. Each library fulfills a
    purpose, so it may be skipped if not needed.
   </p>
   
   <center>
    <?php img("core.png", "Core");?>
   </center>
   
   <p>
    Core EFL components are:
   </p>

    <ul>
     <li><a href=http://trac.enlightenment.org/e/wiki/Evas>Evas</a></li>

    </ul>
   </p>

    Binding support exists for several languages such as:
   </p>

-->
    </ul>
   </p>

    There are other libraries and applications which build on core EFL and
    function on other systems too, providing more functionality, examples, and utility:

   <h3>Devices</h3>

   <p>
    Enlightenment and EFL use desktop Linux systems as a primary method of
    development because it is fast and simple to do so, but all of it is
    written with the express goal in mind of also working on devices from
    Mobile Phones, to Televisions, Netbooks and more.
   </p>

   <center>
    <?php img("phone.png", "Phone");?>
   </center>
   
   <p>
    We have run and tested on x86-32, x86-64, Atom, Power-PC, ARM (ARM9, ARM11,
    Cortex-A8 and more), MIPS, Sparc, and many other architectures. The
    suggested minimum RAM required for a full Linux system + EFL application
    is 16MB, but you may be able to get by on 8MB. For full functionality
    64MB or more is suggested. As little as a 200Mhz ARM core will provide
    sufficient processing power (depending on needs).
   </p>

   <p>
    Screens from even less than QVGA (320x240 or 240x320) screens all the
    way up to and beyond full-HD (1920x1080) are covered by EFL. It has the
    ability to scale user interfaces to almost any sane resolution, as well
    as adapt to differing input device resolutions, from mouse and stylus
    to fat fingers. It can draw displays from e-paper through 8-bit
    paletted displays, 16bit beautifully dithered ones all the way to full
    24/32bit OLED beauties.
   </p>

   <h3>Graphics</h3>
   
   <p>
    Enlightenment is built by designers and programmers who want others to
    be able to do more with less. Some of Enlightenment's libraries do not
    do anything with graphics at all, but it is the ones that do that are
    the shining stars of the Enlightenment world.
   </p>
   
   <p>
    <b>Evas</b> is the canvas layer. It is not a drawing library. It is not
    like OpenGL, Cairo, XRender, GDI, DirectFB etc. It is a scene graph
    library that retains state of all objects in it. They are created then
    manipulated until they are no longer needed, at which point they are
    deleted. This allows the programmer to work in terms that a designer
    thinks of. It is direct mapping, as opposed to having to convert the
    concepts into drawing commands in the right order, calculate minimum
    drawing calls needed to get the job done etc.
   </p>
   
   <p>
    Evas also handles abstracting the rendering mechanism. With zero changes
    the same application can move from software to OpenGL rendering, as they
    all use an abstracted scene graph to describe the world (canvas) to Evas.
    Evas supports multiple targets, but the most useful are the high-speed
    software rendering engines and OpenGL (as well as OpenGL-ES 2.0).
   </p>
   
   <p>
    Evas not only does quality rendering and compositing, but also can
    scale, rotate and fully 3D transform objects, allowing for sought-after
    3D effects in your interfaces. It supplies these abilities in both
    software and OpenGL rendering, so you are never caught with unexpected
    loss of features. The software rendering is even fast enough to provide
    the 3D without any acceleration on devices for simple uses.
   </p>
   
   <p>
    <b>Edje</b> is a meta-object design library that is somewhere between
    Flash, PSD, SVG and HTML+CSS. It separates design out from code and into
    a dynamically loaded data file. This file is compressed and loaded very
    quickly, along with being cached and shared betweeen instances.
   </p>
   
   <p>
    This allows design to be provided at runtime by different design (EDJ)
    files, leaving the programmer to worry about overall application
    implementation and coarse grained UI as opposed to needing to worry about
    all the little details that the artists may vary even until the day
    before shipping the product.
