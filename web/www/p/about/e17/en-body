    <h1>Enlightenment DR17</h1>

    <p>Enlightenment 0.17 is the next generation of UNIX graphical environments. It is not 
    just a window manager, but it is also a desktop shell.  A desktop shell means, a window 
    manager plus a file manager, plus configuration utilitys all in one. They are not 
    separated as usual. Now, let's take a closer look at all E17 features.</p>

    <p>Enlightenment is fast. No, really. It's fast. It is known to run on very slow 
    machines (like 100 Mhz CPU, 64 MB of RAM) well. So you really don't need a modern 
    desktop to see some eye-candy and to use a modern graphical environment. Even more – 
    you can control how fast you want it by using it's Performance configuration panel to 
    change the cache settings and more.</p>

    <p>The high performance does not mean that there is no eye candy. There is eye candy that you 
    have never seen before. Starting from the animated boot screen, to continue with the all 
    animations and effects that themes could provide, to end up with fancy animated backgrounds. 
    But not some huge .GIF files, but really nice animations. Every virtual desktop (at the moment 
    you can have 24) can have it's own background (animated or not), so you can put different 
    wallpapers on the different virtual desktops. There are a number of effects that can be shown 
    when you switch from the different virtual desktops. The menus, the borders and all other usual 
    parts of a normal window manager are animated as well as some of the widgets (the sliders, 
    for example). Remember that those effects are provided by the theme, so every theme makes E to 
    look different, with different effects, look and feel and animations.</p>

    <p>As we already mentioned, E17 provides a file manager as well. Of the time of writing, it is 
    not completed and is in active development (as E17 as a whole itself), but after it is finished 
    it will be a very nice, configurable and eye candy. Even right now, you can do the basic things 
    with it – browse, copy, move, delete files. It will provide thumbnails for your pictures and 
    will be able to open your files with the coresponding application of your choice.</p>

    <p>E17 is highly configurable. Currently it has a nice configuration panel with dialogs for all 
    kinds of things. You can change your wallpaper or your theme, your fonts, your screen resolution, 
    your screen's power settings, your keyboard and mouse settings, the language that Enlightenment 
    talks to you, and so on. You can contol almost every apsect of what E is doing and how. 
    It will do what you want it to do.</p>

    <p>At this moment, E17 is localized in 20 languages, including latin languages like English and 
    French, cyrillic languages like Russian and Bulgarian and even Korean, Chinese, and Japanese. 
    Note that you can change the language on the fly without restarting E or your X server.</p>

    <p>As you already know, Enlightenment 0.17 has lots of features, but one of the most important 
    is, that you can add and remove functionality by using modules. Modules are small applications that 
    extend E17. There can be modules tho show you the weather outside, or calendar modules, or 
    modules to control your volume or whatever you may think. Developing a module is not that hard, so, 
    if you have programming skills, you are more than welcome to develop and maintain some 
    modules for the community.</p>
