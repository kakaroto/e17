<p><b><center>Enlightenment DR17</center></b></p>
<p>Enlightenment 0.17 is the next generation of UNIX graphical environments. It is not only a window manager, but also a desktop shell.
A desktop shell includes the following features: window manager, file manager, and configuration utilities. These features are not separated like other common environments. Now, let's take a closer look at what E17 has to offer...</p>
<center><?php img("performance.png", "E"); ?></center>
<p><b><center>Extremely High Performance.</center></b></p>
<p>Enlightenment is fast. It is known to run well on very slow machines, such as 186 Mhz processors with 128 MB of RAM. This means that you don't have to own the best hardware to get a good desktop experience. Even better, you can control how fast you want it to be by using it's performance configuration panel to change settings such as cache.</p>
<center><?php img("eye_candy.png", "E"); ?></center>
<p><b><center>Eye Candy On A Higher Level</center></b></p>
<p>High performance doesn't mean eye candy was sacrificed. Beautiful graphics and smooth effects make up the visual aspect of enlightenment. From animated boot screens and backgrounds, to the animations and effects that themes provide, the possibilities are amazing. Virtual desktops can have their own background (animated or not). Visual effects can be seen from desktop switching, to window minimizing and maximizing. The menus, borders, widgets, and all other parts of a normal window manager can be animated as well. Effects are provided by the theme, so every theme gives E a different look and feel.</p>
<p><b><center>File Manager</center></b></p>
<p>As we mentioned, E17 provides a file manager as well.  Right now, you can do the basics with it: browse , copy, move, and delete files and directories. It provides thumbnails and will open specified applications based on mimetype.</p>
<p><b><center>Configurable</center></b></p>
<p>E17 is highly configurable. Currently it has a nice configuration panel with 36 configuration dialogs for all of you environment configuration needs. You can change your wallpaper, theme, fonts, screen resolution, screen's power settings, your keyboard and mouse settings and bindings, default language, and much more. You can contol almost every apsect of what E is doing and how.</p>
<p><b><center>Localized</center></b></p>
<p>Currently, E17 is localized in 20 languages. This includes latin languages like English and French, cyrillic languages like Russian and Bulgarian and even Korean, Chinese, and Japanese. Note that you can change the language on the fly without restarting E or your X server.</p>
<p><b><center>Full-featured</center></b></p>
<p>As you already know, Enlightenment 0.17 has many features, but one of the most important is the functionality that you can add and remove with modules. Modules are small applications that extend E17. There are many modules including an application launcher, minimized applications container, pager, battery, temperature, frequency, and clock. Developing a module is simple even for the beggining programmer, and maintained modules are welcomed in the community.</p>

<p><b><center>Standardized</center></b></b>

<p>E17 is following most standards and specifications. NetWM, ICCCM, XDG, Freedesktop, and so on.</p>
