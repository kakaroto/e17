  Many of the core developers involved in Enlightenment as well as a
  lot of users are on IRC. They use IRC often and will discuss many
  development issues there instead of e-mail, due to it having immediate
  feedback as well as convenient shared discussion channels.
 </p>
 <p>
  We use the Freenode IRC network, and you will find us on the <b>#e</b>
  channel. You can use a, IRC client like <a
  href=http://xchat.org/>X-Chat</a>, <a
  href=http://konversation.kde.org/>Konversation</a>,
  <a href=http://www.pidgin.im/>Pidgin</a>, <a
  href=http://www.mibbit.com/>Mibbit</a>, and many others. If your
  client already has a listing for freenode, just select it. If not
  just set up the server as <b>irc.freenode.net</b> as your server
  with the normal IRC port of 6667. Once connected just join <b>#e</b>
  (you can just type in the command: <b>/join #e</b> then Enter). Just
  type + press Enter to talk.
 </p>
 <p>
  Einen deutschsprachigen IRC Channel gibt es auch - <b>#e.de</b>. Per
  gli utenti di lingua italiana è disponibile il canale <b>#e-it</b>.
  Pour le Français, nous avons <b>#e.fr</b>.

 <h2>Professional</h2>

 <p>
  Several companies and individuals provide professional support and
  services related to EFL and Enlightenment. If you find yourself in
  need of help that the community can't provide, please feel free to
  contact any of the list below.
 </p>

  Just remember that community support isn't guaranteed. It's done on a
  volunteer/freetime basis. For guaranteed response and support, you'll
  want to consider professional grade suppliers.

  Our primary non-realtime form of communication is via e-mail. This
  allows everyone to participate no matter what timezone the live in or
  what waking hours they keep. It allows for streamlined access via
  your favorite e-mail application, which should handle large volumes
  of messages and conversations well already. It allows for off-line
  reading and replies (unlike web forums or IRC),
 </p>
 <p>
  The language used on our mailing lists is English. It is a universal
  language that more people speak than any other, so if you want to
  participate, please use English, and then everyone can understand
  and respond. Also note that these lists are public and everyone sees
  the e-mails sent to them, and anyone may respond. Not all answers will
  be correct, but the vast majority will be.
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition to the lists being a forum for questions, suggestions and
  other such discussions, they are also used as a news feed. Especially
  our commits mailing list. Every piece of code changed, bug fixed, or
  feature added will be broadcast on our commits mailing list. If you
  want to know what is going on, our commits list is an absolute must to
  subscribe to.
 </p>
 <p>
  We have 3 main lists. <a
  href=https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/enlightenment-svn>The
  SVN Commits List</a> is for sending out notices of every commit that
  happens to our repositories, with full source diffs, log and who
  did the work. <a
  href=https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/enlightenment-devel>The
  Devel List</a> is where most of the developer and development
  discussions happen. This list will be more technical that the Users
  list. <a
  href=https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/enlightenment-users>The
  Users List</a> is where regular user discussions will happen.
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition we have the <a
  href=https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/enlightenment-announce>
  Announce List</a> for official announcements (like releases of new
  software). <a
  href=https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/enlightenment-intl>The
  Intl List</a> is for posting changes to internationalization like
  updated PO files. <a
  href=https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/enlightenment-bugs>The
  Bugs List</a> is for broadcasting bug reports (though the way trac
  works currently for us, it will only be used if added to the cc list).

 <p>
  We use <a href=http://trac.enlightenment.org/e/>Trac</a> for our Bug
  tracking and wiki. If you have a bug or issue, please <a
  href=http://trac.enlightenment.org/e/report>Report</a> a bug. We will
  eventually get to it, but try and assign it to someone appropriate
  so it gets attention. We list all our developers on our <?php
  a("contact", "contact");?> page.
 </p>
 <p>
  Please use the tracker for bugs, not for discussions or feature
  requests or for "I don't know how to do this" questions. It's for
  reporting actual problems. For questions we have E-Mail and IRC. Also
  remember that we will prioritize bug fixing to those things that are
  core, urgent or necessary, so just because a report isn't acted on
  soon, doesn't mean we won't eventually get to it. Once it's in the
  system it won't disappear. It just takes it being noticed.
 </p>
 <p>
  To report a bug, go to <a
  href=http://trac.enlightenment.org/e/report>Trac Bugs</a>.

 <h2>Wiki</h2>

 <p>
  We have split our website into 2 major parts. The main less-changing
  pages such as this and a <a
  href=http://trac.enlightenment.org/e/wiki>Wiki</a>. This Wiki is
  where anyone can edit and contribute documentation, information and
  similar pages.
 </p>
 <p>
  Feel free to browse around the <a

  you are looking for is over there, or if you wish to contribute
