<b>Jeremy: Do you see the current feature set of e15 in CVS as being the
 feature set for the release of E15?</b>
<br>
<br>
Raster: close - a bit of cleaning up.. I've made a start on menus - a lot of
additions aren't quite apparent - eesh (e shell) is an interface
(command-line like ashell) to E's IPC mechanism. - so there's a lot
more going in the backend of IPC - basically E is beginning to
understand more IPC commands. A lot of this I am generating for use in
the GUI E configuration I'm writing (in C) for GNOME. - it queries E
itself for E's configuration - so you get live settings and when you
change things it send IPc back to E telling it to change it's config.
This means the configuration applet doesn't have to have any clue what
the configuration files look like, where they are stored etc. and
doesnt have to tell E even to restart - this is the mechanism that will
be prevalent through E's configuration in future.
<br>
<br>
Mandrake: there will be at least a few more things added in before 0.15 comes 
out.  Containers and some config changes (we're going over that right now), at bare minimum.
<br>
<br>
Technoir: Pretty much, although Raster added the beginning of the root
menu code at the weekend (I thought root menus weren't going to be in
DR0.15), so
that'll need finishing. Also, containers for iconised windows and
docked apps will probably be a rather important feature in the next
release.
<br>
<br>
<b>Jeremy: When do you estimate DR0.15 to actually be released?</b>
<br>
<br>
Raster: No comment :)
<br>
<br>Mandrake: Released? Oh you mean we're supposed to release this
stuff? D'oh! I knew there was something I kept forgetting about...
Seriously, though, I
don't like giving release dates for this stuff any more. Last time I
gave out a release date I was 6 weeks off. This year, most likely, at
some point.
Beyond that I don't know.
<br>
<br>
Technoir: Considering the release date for DR0.14 was 24th May and it was
actually released on the 18th of July, I don't think proposing a release
date would be sensible.
<br>
<br>
<b>Jeremy: What do you currently see as the major problems of E?</b>
<br>
<br>Raster: Lack of features. The backend design is now solid and
workable. Mainly our work is cut out for adding features in a clean,
solid and
extensible manner. There is, of course, work to be done in the areas of
optimizing internal data tracking code (the list code) that to date has
been stable and DAMN useful in being able to generate, database then
find later chunks of data easily. This can be optimized by splitting
the
list into smaller segments based on data type, possibly hashing etc..
we
have our ideas for that already... just have to go do it... the other
thing we need to do it split the configuration a little more and have e
autosave more data and allow the config to "modify" theme provided
defaults when it encounters a user-specified components of the same
name, using the user-specified values over and above those specified by
the theme.
<br>
<br>
Mandrake: Problems?  Well - sometimes the very thing that you like the most
about a piece of software is the thing that's also the biggest drawback.  It
used to be speed was a main concern - but that problem is pretty much taken
care of.  Nowadays it's just a matter of configuration complexity.
Configuration being E's biggest strength, it also causes a lot of people to
turn away: "Wow, this is really cool, but it's too hard to make it do exactly
what I want."  I hear that a lot.  I expect a lot of that to be taken care of
very soon with the advent of a slightly improved configuration model (don't
worry if you're using the current configuration syntax and you want to keep
that stuff working!  it will (I hope *grin*)  there's just some more cool stuff in the works.
<br>
<br>Technoir: The main questions on #E about E are probably concerning
the required image libraries for E and the configuration code. It would
be nice if there was only one image library (imlib) which could process
every
image format needed by E, then use other, less used image formats, use
optional separate libs. This would probably avoid many of those
'Multiple Headers' problems. Although if people who didn't know where
headers were installed too used RPMs or .debs it would help. <br>
<br>
As for the config system, people always moan about ConfigEdit not being
able to create new classes, then when told that they should edit their
.cfg files by hand, they just give up.
<br>
<br>
Another main problem with E is that people, for some reason, lack the
ability to read the documents, help files or error messages. People
always coming to #E, with say a compile time problem, where the error
they get basically tells them what to do. Again people who can't read
should use packages of E, and not the source code. No doubt there will
be someone who has got the CVS version of E running, then decides to
install the RPMs of DR0.15, when it's released, basically stopping
anything which uses imlib compiling in the future. 
<br>
<br>
<b>Jeremy: Are you more concerned with having every possible feature or
with getting out a timely release for Enlightenment version 1.0?</b>
<br>
<br>
Raster: Features. e 0.15 (under development) CVS is stable nearly all
the time. Every now and again we twiddle with a new feature that may
break stuff
temporarily, but otherwise it's pretty good. This is the development
method we wish to keep. So basically any "latest release" will be
pretty much stable. 1.0 to me for Enlightenment means I am happy with
its feature set and stability - and that I need not keep working on it
immediately and can take a rest and let everyone use it and have fun
without demanding for new features because the feature is already
there. We do wish to get a 1.0 release out - but not just because of
the label of "1.0" - it is meaningless if 1.0 is missing things and we
need a 1.1, 1.2, 1.5, 2.0 etc. to finally get E to a point of
"happiness". beyond 1.0 would be some major additions to E - possibly
shift of windowing system if needed / required, and work on X itself to
add extensions for possibly new fancy features that X simply didn't
allow us to do before.
<br>
<br>
Mandrake: Right now we have a serious focus on quality of release.  I don't
think that everything under the sun will be implemented by 1.0, but I expect
that's going to be off by at least a year or two. :)
<br>
<br>
Technoir: Probably the most important consideration in a 1.0 release, which
you've not mentioned, is stability. As far as I remember the DR0.14
release had no serious bugs in it, in fact the only one which I even
heard of was the $EROOT problem with certain systems.
<br>
<br>
<b>Jeremy: Do you see any major speed bottlenecks currently in
Enlightenment; either due to the current way things are implemented or due to external bottlenecks (such as X servers, etc)</b>
<br>
<br>
Raster: Most of the speed bottleneck is X - basically X can only move windows
and stuff on a graphic's card so fast. The truetype font renderer is
hell on overhead just to be able to implement anti-aliasing - so if X
did this it would be an instance speedup. The other bottleneck is imlib
it can only load/render so fast. Most of E's problems in speed are
simply Xserver-bound. A fast Xserver setup properly with all things
turned on and imlib with all options turned on will be pretty damn fast.
<br>
<br>
Mandrake: Well - there are always things that you can do to improve speed in
anything - but you're not going to notice it unless the speed improvements are
done in the image loading/rendering department at this point.  There may be
bits that are improvable, but by and large the problems are going to be in X
server performance at this point (and maybe the layers underneath imlib - i.e.
libpng, libgif, etc).  I have a standing offer to buy dinner with whoever can
make the Shape Extension use hardware acceleration.
<br>
<br>Technoir: The main bottleneck which I've experienced is the use of
shaped pixmaps(one reason why the default theme was changed, as for
some reason
people judge the speed of something by what it does the first time they
install it)
<br>
<br>
<b>Jeremy: From my experience, I have noticed that E seems slow at times.
Is this mainly due to the developmental nature of it currently, and in it's
final incarnation, do you see it running better on lower-end systems?</b>
<br>
<br>
Raster: Slow at times? In what sense "at times"? E has lots of knobs and
twiddles - an example is when you flip desktops E will dynamically load
and render a new background for the new visible desktop if there wasn't
one there already. If you dont look at a desktop for more than X
minutes E will destroy the background, clear the background, and thus save
memory on the server-side - but this means next time you look at the
desktop E has to re-load the image. It saves on RAM but eats more CPU -
its a RAM/CPU tradeoff. This option is customisable - you can even turn
it off so E never unloads and frees desktop backgrounds.
<br>
<br>
E will tend to run better on low-end systems than most WM's - for one
reason. E auto-adjusts all the stuff it does to run at the same speed
irrespective of machine speed - so the faster the machine, the smoother
things are - not the faster they are - shading speed, sliding, etc. all
are based on pixels / second and thus it will perform well on lower
systems by keeping up with the machine and user rather than lagging
behind.
<br>
<br>Mandrake: Well - the biggest slow spots are image caching issues.
Typically if you don't go to a desktop that has a different background
loaded in it,
enlightenment has unloaded that graphic from memory to conserve on
memory
usage. This helps keep the memory usage down. Going to that desktop
again can give you a speed hit.
<br>
<br>Technoir: The current release of E is much faster than the earlier
releases, and the version in CVS is even faster, mainly due to the new
theme.
<br>
<br>
I saw a rather massive speed increase, especially when it redraws a
complete desktop (for example at startup) since I've used mtrr in the
kernel. Basically X runs much faster and everything seems a lot smoother.
<br>
<br>
The only time I find a big slowdown compared to earlier releases is
when changing desktops, as Imlib caches the images. It can take a good
2-3 secs for a new desktop to appear in Hand of God.
<br>
<br>
<b>Emissary: Do you think E will be a default window manager
in the near future (for redhat, debian, or any other distribution)?</b>
<br>
<br>
Raster: I don't know about anyone else, but right now it seems E will be the
default WM to ship with GNOME on Red Hat since it is getting all the
GNOME support added on a daily basis and has a GNOME integrated
configuration program that makes it easy for a user to change common
settings for the WM in a very clean manner.
<br>
<br>Mandrake: At least not until after 0.15 or 0.16 is out. There's
still too much that we don't do yet. Everything from 0.13 and prior was
thrown out the door for 0.14, so we're basically coming up on the 2nd
release of this shortly :) I'd say you'd DEFINITELY want to wait until
after this release or the next one before you thought about doing that.
<br>
<br>Technoir: I think it will end up as the default WM for GNOME, and
with probably be the default WM for any distributions which bundle
GNOME in their
system. I doubt this will happen for a while, at least not until GNOME
is stable and E reaches towards 1.0. <br>
<br>
<b>Emissary:  Do you see E DR 0.14 as the last complete
rewrite of E?</b>
<br>
<br>
Raster: Until 1.0 - yes. After 1.0 I have no clue - depends if we stick
to X or not. If we stick to X probably not - there is a lot of solid
back-end
there. I don't see much of a reason to spend time nuking it and
restarting.
<br>
<br>
Mandrake: There's always a nasty habit of saying "damn, I'll never do that
again" but you usually end up doing it anyways.  0.14 was written from the
ground up because the model from 0.13 and prior just wasn't good enough for
where we wanted to go.  
<br>
<br>Technoir: Most likely, although most of the code could be changed
without anyone knowing, assuming the configuration code is the same. I
doubt that it
will ever be rewritten from scratch, as the current code seems to works
as well as most people would expect.
<br>
<br>
<b>Emissary: Is the current line (E .14 and .E. 15) what the 1.0 release
will look like?</b>
<br>
<br>
Raster: Probably - very similar at any rate.
<br>
<br>Mandrake: Internally? probably we'll keep this same structure
codewise.
Externally? well - there's a new look every couple of months or so. I
don't
know about you, but I get bored of looking at the same thing every day.
I live in front of my computer - it's gotta be pleasant to the eye :)
<br>
<br>Technoir: Probably not. The default theme has changed twice since
the pre-releases of DR0.14, and I would imagine that it'll be changed
for DR0.16 too. <br>
<br>
<b>Emissary: Technoir, you run e.themes.org,  what made you want to help
run E's themes site versus another window manager?</b>
<br>
<br>
Mandrake: He didn't want to.  I had to threaten his computer :)
<br>
<br>
Technoir: As far as I'm concerned there are very few (if any) other WMs which
allow the same level of customization as E. Say, for Window Maker, the
themes as basically colour schemes and new application icons. You could
easily spot any Window Maker desktop a mile off, as the windows and the
general desktop, will retain the same structure. With E, you can make
the desktop look and behave almost anyway you like. If you just showed
someone a screenshot of both the default theme and of Hand of God, I
think it would be difficult for them to accept that they were both
using the same engine. 
<br>
<br>
<b>Emissary: Technoir, what do you see as Enlightenment's best features?
</b><br>
<br>
Technoir: I have to say, I love the new config system. It's much easier to do
things that in the older versions, and allows for much greater variety
of options.
<br>
<br>
<b>Emissary: Technoir, what would you like to see in future incarnations
of E (features, looks, etc.)?</b>
<br>
<br>
Technoir: If menus and containers are up to scratch in DR0.15, the next
needed feature will be the pagers. How exactly this will be done, I
have no
idea, as they are not just desktops any more. They are movable windows,
so a simple fvwm style pager (4 desktops in a square) probably won't
work as the desktops are not next to each other in the same way as they
are in fvwm. <br>
<br>
<b>Emissary: What type of system do you test and run E on? Furthermore, what
would you like to see as the minimum system requirements to run E well?
</b><br>
<br>
Raster: Umm.. sorry to disappoint but I actually test e on PII-30''s
with 128Mb and Millenium II 8mb cards (one PCI one AGP) - I dont often
sit at any
other machine since these 2 are my work and home boxes. I have
personally run E on alphas, sparcs and ARM machines quite happily - but
I dont actually test it because I simply dont have those machines
myself. I'm not wealthy by any means. I only own 1 computer - its no a
shabby one, but I don't have the money to go buying 5 different
architectures. I'd love to test it on all but as a free software
developer doing this in his spare time evenings and weekend I make do
with what I have. I need a box in front of me since this is X
development I need to SEE whats going on and that means I need to buy a
machine and a display for it (running remotely onto another display
docent help debug local display bugs / characteristics).
<br>
<br>

Mandrake: I have run E on everything from a 486/33 with either 16 or 24 megs of
ram (I don't remember) to a pII/333 with 128+ megs of ram.  I was shocked when
I noticed how well E held up on the low end system, actually.  (whilst we were
up in northern Virginia a week or two ago, we installed E on a 486 for some guy
- simply amazing that it held up so well)
<br>
<br>Technoir: I run E on a Dual PII 300 with 320Mb RAM. I generally
don't test it, but as I use it a number of problems invariably appear.
The minimum
system requirements are probably more specific to the theme rather than
the window manager as a whole. You could, for example, make a very
simple theme, which would probably run fine on a low end system
(486/sx or something). <br>
<br>
<b>Barath: What is the extent of gnome support in E, as it was one of the
first WM's that had some gnome support?
</b><br>
<br>
Raster: Well currently ICEWM, E and WindowMaker have GNOME support in
order of most extensive / working and useable support E is on the top -
ICEWM is
close (needs some changes to "catch up") and WindowMaker is um...
fairly behind. There have been proposals for gnome WM hints on pages
for months and they are free to implement them but haven't yet -
gnome.c from E's source tree in GNOME cvs is a pretty good level of
documentation and a startpoint for gnome compliance. It's fully
commented.
<br>
<br>
Mandrake: basically, E is the standard of gnome support, seeing as gnome hint
stuff goes into E first for testing :)
<br>
<br>
Technoir: Since Raster wrote the first GNOME hints code into E, it basically
defines the extent of the GNOME support.

<br>
<br>
<b>Barath: Mandrake, do you see the E config editor being able to
graphically configure all elements of E?</b>
<br>
<br>Mandrake: That is the goal, here. You shouldn't HAVE to ever touch
the config file if you don't want to, although there may be some
advantages to it, if you're an advanced user.
<br>
<br>
<b>Barath: How do you make the graphics for the default theme for E?  What
is your inspiration for its design/look/feel?
</b><br>
<br>
Raster: Ummmmm... inspiration.. Don't know.. I just.. um.. drew... :) I use
gimp for all of E's graphics. I've always likes dark displays and thus
the display is darkish. Apart form that it's all free-form. :)
<br>
<br>
<b>Barath: What other features do you want to add to E before you release
0.15?</b>
<br>
<br>Raster: More IPC, make menus work - cleanup tooltips, a few more
toggle options for E's behavior, and a definite config file cleanup.
Containers need
to get finished too, and all current "features in progress" need
finishing. Then comes QA for a while to weed out little buglets and
strange stuff before the 0.15 release. Then its time to start on 0.16
:)
<br>
<br>Mandrake: Containers - basically a much more powerful concept than
the iconbox, but that's where the original concept came from. Imagine
smaller desktop-like things that you can drag around like a window (not
just like the floating desktops - these can be any size with or without
handles) that can
automatically or forcefully take windows/buttons/etc. and you can
choose the
buttons that can go in it, or the windows, etc...
<br>
<br>
<b>Barath: What res mode do you run E in?</b>
<br>
<br>
Raster: at home 1280x1024, at work 1600x1200 or 1920x1440 depending on what
mood I'm in :)
<br>
<br>
Mandrake: I don't like to run in anything less than 1280x1024, but we try to
make sure everything looks okay in 640x480, too.
<br>
<br>Technoir: 1600 x 1200, although I have used it at 1024 x 768, but
again, it does depend on the theme. There is no reason why you couldn't
run it at
640x480, although how anyone can use X, never mind a WM, at that
resolution I don't know.
<br>
<br>
<b>Barath: Raster, what are your goals for imlib 2?
</b><br>
<br>Raster: Layer-based graphics engine with image loading and
rendering abilities, pixmaps and image sharing between clients (so
server based),
anti-aliased scaling, arbitrary mapping routines to allow arbitrary
rotation and scaling of layers and images, alpha channel compositing,
speedups here and there.. and more. Also possible threading of
rendering
routines for SMP machines (ie spawn 4 rendering threads for a 4CPU
machine to max out its processing power). This is a big project -
ambitious but doable - it will take a long time to see it come to
completion though.
<br>
<br>
<b>Barath: Technoir, as a theme creator, do you find the configuration of
themes in E 0.14 and 0.15 to be easier or harder to use?  Do you find it to be much more powerful?
</b><br>
<br>
Technoir: The new configuration system is a lot more powerful than in earlier
releases. It it also much more consistent, in that in earlier releases
each file for each part of theme, had it's own specific structure and
style. The current .cfg setup is a lot cleaner and due to the way in
which the actionclasses and such like are done, duplication of a
specific method, be it a class to run an Eterm or to kill a window, is
alot easier. If I had, say, 20 buttons which each load gimp, and each
used the same actionclass then to make it load xv when you hold down
alt could be done a lot quicker as only a single part of the code would
have to be altered, rather than 20.

Subject: The problem with non-FVWM window managers<br><br>Is that, despite all their new features, they don't get the basic brilliance of FVWM right: virtual desktops.
<br>

<br>
I've tried all the other window managers, and even though they often
have cool new things I'd like to have on my fvwm desktop, the lack of
the virtual desktops ALWAYS brings me back to fvwm.
<br>

<br>Virtual desktops are intuitive. I've seen several windows and mac
users come to Linux, and comment on how much they like the virtual
desktops.
<br>

<br>If it's not broke why fix it? Window Makers workspaces are not the
same. E's sliding desktops are not the same. A linear sequence of
desktops is just NOT THE SAME as having a 2D geometric representation.
I know where my applications are geometrically on my 3x3 desktop setup.
I can think "I've got my emacs in the top left corner" and instantly
slide over there with the mouse, or even faster with the ctrl-arrow
combination with one hand. Compare this to the linear arrangement of E
or window maker ("was my emacs on desk 4 or 7?").
<br>

<br>E seems to emphasize configurability, but I was dissappointed when
I read in this interview that ONCE AGAIN they would fail to allow us
implement a "simple FVWM pager". Simple does not mean bad. Please prove
me wrong and give us the flexibility to have a "simple fvwm-style
pager"!
<br>

<br>
I want to use E for its other great features, but sometimes "feel" is more important than "look".

Subject: fvwm style pagers<br><br>You
can't beat the fvwm pager, you can easily scoot windows arround and
between the desktops. At a glance you knowwhere everything is and if
something is on another desktop and you want it on the current one, you
just drag it on over... I'm not real crazy about the sliding desktops.
It's much less powerfull given the speed problems in rasterizing the
background for the window if the background has come out of cache. I
jst feels clunky to slide the windows arround too... you have a
layering problem.. I know there are some advanced controls for that,
but I would like to think that the development crew is looking for some
intuitiveness about the environment. <br>
The other trend seems to be the buttons used in CDE and KDE... This is
really silly to me... it takes away the ability to look at the pager
and see where what and move it without the window manager haveing to
actually display the desktop.
<br>

<br>As far as the arguement about the pager "taking up a large portion
of the screen", buy a larger monitor or run a higher resolution! This
isn't windoez, we KNOW better than to try to use a low resolution
display for a GUI.<br>[ <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19990826131641/http://www.linuxpower.org/reply_comment.phtml?comment=184">Reply to this</a> ]<br></font><hr>

Subject: MMX and E<br><br>The
bit about WinNT5 and the fading menues. I beta-test NT5, and fading
menues and window-wipes, etc dont use OpenGL, then use MMX. I
personally dont care much for any Microsoft O/S. But MS is smart in
that they use MMX to enhance the speed of graphics processes.
<br>

<br>I love E, it is absolutly bar-non the prettiest window manager that
I have ever seen. It also hase a very complete feature set. Stability
is also a non-problem (compared to WinNT). My only problem with it is
speed. When compared to BlackBox or Window Maker, E crawls. I know that
you cant have your cake and eat it too, but with Unix and E, who knows!
I would love to see Enlightenment support MMX. It could help speed up
image processing greatly. It would also open possibilities such as REAL
transparency for Eterm, fading menues, faster window sliding (when
windows slide onto the desktop) and more.
<br>

<br>I know platform portability is an issue, but I'm not asking E to
solely support Intel MMX processors. Just add support, and use MMX if
it is available.
<br>

Subject: When will E respect the Gnome panel ?<br><br>I love E and GNOME, and i use it in my daily work.
<br>
I just have one question:
<br>

<br>
When will E (and other GNOME-complaint wms) begin to respect the GNOME-panel ?
<br>

<br>
So that you could maximize the windows whitout having to mimimize the panel and resize the windows ?
<br>

<br>btw, When (if) shipping it with RH6.0, make sure there are LOTS of
themes on the CD :) (and of course, a way of handling these in the
Gnome-E-capplet(the same goes for GTK+ themes)
<br>

<br>
Very very nice work people !
