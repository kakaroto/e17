Main stuff:

- **** FIX BUGS!!!! **** (like the problem when you close options and show it again)

Medium priority:

- do documentation, implement its own public API.
- write plugin system
- fix estickies so it does not run only under X11 - make it run on Windows.

Nice to have:

- Sqlite for stickies
- plugins for drawer and everything e17 modules
- add some more stuff here to this TODO
