## E17 builder script for Debian, Ubuntu and its derivatives ##
1. Copy pbuilder-config to your home folder UNDER NAME .pbuilderrc
2. Copy the script wherever you want
3. Open the script in the text editor and modify variables in the beginning as you want(like compile list, distro list, svn username..)
4. Run a terminal and cd to that dir
5. Run the script with --help and you will see possible parameters and their order(setup, download, makechroots, compile, prepare, database, upload and finally clean if you don't need local repos anymore.)

# if you compile for debian squeeze or ubuntu jaunty, replace /usr/share/cdbootstrap/suites with suites file here.
# short versions of script arguments are also available( --compile or -c etc.. run the script with --help or -h).
# run --update or -U when you want to update base tarballs.

## E17 changelog script for Debian, Ubuntu and its derivatives ##
It can
   1) generate a new changelog template from working but out of date changelog
   2) fill the template generated with initiate

It is not needed to run initiate mostly, because the changelogs are already initiated here in SVN. And update too not, because source packages are made by me and uploaded on packages.enlightenment.org :) i put it there only for people who could use it for something and also because all my work is open source.

Usage:
	Generate new changelog template from working but out-of-date changelog(you can't generate template from template because dpkg-parsechangelog refuses to accept @DATE@ etc) - ./changelogs.sh initiate
	Fill the changelog template: ./changelogs.sh update
