	Version 1.5 released
		- This version should hopefully appease alot of the people who have
		  been asking for new features.  If anyone needs it, I might add some
		  support for opening things in a terminal.  It would probably be a 
		  command line option/symlink since having a check would ruin the nice
		  interface :)  For now though this could be a achieved by running your
		  term with the correct args to open a program.
