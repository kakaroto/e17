4-05-08 -- Version 1.5.2
	- Update for ewl_password removal.
3-31-08 -- Version 1.5.1
  - Fix an issue with the entry boxes collapsing when empty.
5-31-07 -- Version 1.5
	- Starting empower with no options will allow you to specify a command in
	  the window.  If you need to authenticate, you will also type in your
	  password.
	- There are labels on the entries now so you know what you need to type in.
	  They are dynamic and will disappear when you focus the entry, and reappear
	  if you have not typed anything on unfocus.  On startup all you need to do
	  is start typing and the proper entry will start accepting your key 
	  presses.
	- Empower askpass support is final with the addition of the empower-askpass
	  symlink.  Using the symlink will start empower in askpass mode.
	- Requires a version of EWL after 5-31-07
5-29-07 -- Version 1.0
	- Empower now behaves much more like sudo itself.  It respects the timeout
	  and also will reask if you mistype your password.  The amount of retries
	  is all based on your settings in the sudoers file.
	- Also, command line options can be passed to sudo as well as EWL on the
	  empower command line.
	- With the massive changes and cleanups, this release deserves a 1.0 :)
