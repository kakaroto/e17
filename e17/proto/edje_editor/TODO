TODO edje_editor (not a complete list...only the first in my mind)
=======================================

* Tooltips EVERYWERE  :)

* Up and Down buttons must move the selected part/description up and down
   (have to wait a way to move the row of the tree)

* RelSpinner don't have to stop at 1.0 an 0 but ?? (maybe 100 -100)

* make the interface fit well ats 1024x768

* A new object add must be take a progressive (and unique) number (newrect1, newrect2...etc)

* Text object: GLOW? GLOW2? FAR? ... does edje suport this?

* Make the visible checkbox work (should the visibility apply to the EDC also? not only in the editor?)

* Image: border don't do nothing...why?
