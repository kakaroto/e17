TODO edje_editor (not a complete list...only the first in my mind)
=======================================

* make better file dialogs

* If save failed the original file is deleted (bad engrave  !)

* Tooltips EVERYWERE  :)

* Up and Down buttons must move the selected part/description up and down
   (have to wait a way to move the rows in the etk_tree)

* A new object add must be take a progressive (and unique) number (newrect1, newrect2...etc)

* Make the visible checkbox work (should the visibility apply to the EDC also? not only in the editor?)

* Improve programs frame (add more combo entry widget and filter source combo 
   to only parts that accept mouse events)
   
* Duplicate objects (copy/cut/paste??)

* Review and commit some PROTO_engrave functions

* Fix strange alpha premul on text with effect

* Use a value in the edje data field to store the editor version
  If no version information found alert the user
  
* In the Add/Remove menus disable 'not in context' choice
