Entrance Widgets
===================
- No proper tracking of objects is being done, hence no proper freeing is being done.
- Need more widgets... yesterday!!!
	- ew_imagelist
- group types are currently hash defined'd ints. should be enums
- use ecore_lists to hold buttons and other *low life* widgets used on composite widgets.
- AT some point, we'll need to use tables to layout stuff. Free flowing with parralel hboxes just pains the eyes
- show that we either need or do not need radio buttons / toggle buttons.
- add cleaner interface for radio groups handling.


GUI
==================
- implement sessions screen
- Modify egui_graphics_selector and see if it can also inherit from egui_settings
- There's a todo above some commented code in egui_graphics_selector.c related to making the preview even more awesome.
- We should have a way to show a COMPLETE entrance preview i think in the main ui screen or something, that shows the greetings, etc... so when we change stuff, we can see how it looks like. This is different from the theme and background previews, which only show what the theme and background look like, but hey, maybe we should combine them? Dunno... not critical, just a nice to have feature.
	
***SHOW STOPPERS - TOP PRIORITY
============================
 - egui_settings.c currently doesn't save back to ecore_properly. there is something wrong when trying to retrieve tack the *item from the global *items list; i'm too sleepy to do this now. Correct this first, then move over behavior.c to use this.
- theme and background dialogs need a way to browse filesystem to grab from arbitrary locations.
	- fileselector widget needs to be done.
- Fix up Fileselector widget. This may probably need to refactor out the buttons used by ew_notice as ew_reponse_buttons ?
- Entrance_List needs to be refactored to use as common a base as possible. Also, we need to select the first row by default when adding to a list.

Issues that MUST go before tree relocates to entrance's tree
============================================================
- Mem is not handled properly, we're just coding, no free's. Valgrind must be run thru before we even dream of moving into entrance's src tree.
- Formating is currently not like the rest of e.
