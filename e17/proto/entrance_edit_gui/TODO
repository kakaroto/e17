Entrance Widgets
===================
- No proper tracking of objects is being done, hence no proper freeing is being done.
- Need more widgets... yesterday!!!
	- ew_imagelist
- group types are currently hash defined'd ints. should be enums
- use ecore_lists to hold buttons and other *low life* widgets used on composite widgets.
- AT some point, we'll need to use tables to layout stuff. Free flowing with parralel hboxes just pains the eyes
- show that we either need or do not need radio buttons / toggle buttons.
- add cleaner interface for radio groups handling.


GUI
==================
- implement sessions screen
- We should have a way to show a COMPLETE entrance preview i think in the main ui screen or something, that shows the greetings, etc... so when we change stuff, we can see how it looks like. This is different from the theme and background previews, which only show what the theme and background look like, but hey, maybe we should combine them? Dunno... not critical, just a nice to have feature.
- If we click on a file in the file selector let it appear in the Preview object of the theme/background dialog.
	
***SHOW STOPPERS - TOP PRIORITY
============================
- fileselector integration into theme and background dialogs.
- Entrance_List needs to be refactored to use as common a base as possible. Also, we need to select the first row by default when adding to a list.

Issues that MUST go before tree relocates to entrance's tree
============================================================
- Mem is not handled properly, we're just coding, no free's. Valgrind must be run thru before we even dream of moving into entrance's src tree.
- Formating is currently not like the rest of e.
