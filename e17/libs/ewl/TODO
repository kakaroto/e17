EWL BUGS
========

-  Scrollbar jumps when trying to drag the button from its lower part
-  Default theme when using the imenu/menu the submenu dosen't highlight on
   mouse over.
-  Spinner seems to resize itself slightly larger even when it dosen't have too.
-  The ewl_test seems to get a small gap between the right edje of the
   test and the trough for the scrollbar. Should be flush.
        - The 'Password' test seems to make this gap grow.
-  Dialog text bounds are not considered when packing the window
-  Grid and Table layouts do not pack or resize correctly. The child show
   and resize callbacks do not set the preferred inner size, this is 
   necessary for correct initial size. Their logic is just plain wrong 
   right now.
-  Seem to have lost the .. entry in the filedialog files list.
   Something wrong with the regex's or caused by something in
   ecore_file
-  In ewl_text if your in a multiline text and on a line that is longer
   then then one above or below and you hit the up arrow it will
   position your cursor one character _before_ the end of the line.
-  The ewl_password entry needs to correctly deal with selections and
   mouse clicks.
-  Tab focus dosen't correctly cycle to the start/end of the tab
   widgets if you hit the end
-  Buttons don't correctly react to a keypress. Currently just a
   printf, should actually trigger the button pressed callback
-  Widgets need a focused state in the edje so we can know where the focus is
-  Radio and check buttons should react to key presses and toggle as needed
-  How to deal with the scrollpane with the focus? Currently widgets
   marked INTERNAL are ignored on the inital add. Should the scrollpane 
   find itself in the tab list on SHOW and substitue the seekers instead?
-  Menus will activate on tab, but it jumps to the submenu instead of
   each menu item
-  Run the 'ewl_test text' and click on the end of the first widiget
   and type a few chars (should be in red) now, use the arrow keys to
   move the cursor back to the black text. The cursor will jump to 
   the beginning when you cursor over the first red char and then back
   to the correct spot.
-  If you run ewl_test and select a test the main window will have the
   tests code filled in. The scrollpane ends up being twice as big as
   it should be.
-  The text widget dosen't handle the wrap flag correctly.
-  The Ewl_Menu dosen't work correclty anymore. Once the menu is opened, 
   as soon as the mouse moves the menu is closed again. (Possibly due to
   the embed changing the focused widget?)


EWL TODO
========
- Ability to attach arbitrary cursors to each widget. Attachment portion done,
  need to add cursor code.

- In ewl_init should options be parsed after loading config values from
  ecore_config. ewl_init_parse_options() vs. ewl_config_init()

- fix mismatch between use_engine in ewl_init() and ewl_config.evas.render_method 

- Ewl_Entry 
    - Need to make the text scroll over as you type past the end of the entry box.

- ColorChooser needs a slider for choosing alpha too, and an int a parameter for
  get / set to match [I'm handling this -- dj2]

- Enabled/Disabled status for ALL applicable widgets.

- Need to return a context when items are pushed onto the status bar so that
  a context can be removed without popping off the stack

- The placement of the tooltips needs to be smarter. Currently it just
  places off of the right bottom, but that should be adjusted depending on
  where we are relative to the window border

- Multi-select file dialog needs to highlight selections and append
  filenames in the text field.

- Need to do some work on the tree.
  - add ability to wrap text in tree nodes
  - add ability to clear all rows under a parent row
  - add ability to set row to expand when item clicked (ie
    ewl_tree_row_expand_on_click_set())
  - horizontal scrolling is wacked
  - add ability to turn highlight off for certain rows/nodes
  - scrollbar dosen't always appear when expected using the tree
  - if you have the tree so it has the scroll bar appear, if you're at the
    bottom of the scrollarea and you expand a row, the text shoudln't shift
    up. The scrollpane should be adjusted so the line you expanded stays
    where it is and everything shifts down.

- Tree selection mode set and themeing (MULTI/SINGLE/EXTENDED/NONE).
  - Invert on mouse click (behavior depends upon select mode).
  - determination of whether a row is selected or not (ewl_[tree_]row_selected).
