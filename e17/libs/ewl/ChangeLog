	* Made Ewl_Table layout its children correctly.
	* Some cleanups in the ewl_test program.

Sun Oct  21 18:24:57 2001 Christopher Rosendahl <crosendahl@northernwatch.com>
	* The Ewl_Window now inherits from Ewl_Box.
	* Ewl_Scrollbar cleanups.

Tue Oct  09 09:37:56 2001 Christopher Rosendahl <crosendahl@northernwatch.com>
	* Now move to the page after the one removed by
	  ewl_notebook_remove_visible() instead of just jumping to the first
	  page.
	* Made the notebook use its special .bits.db.

Tue Oct  09 07:49:30 2001 Christopher Rosendahl <crosendahl@northernwatch.com>
	* When a widget is destroyed it now removes itself from it's parent
	  list of children.
	* It is now possible to remove pages from a Ewl_Notebook.
	* Fixed possible segv in ewl_theme_get_str().
	* ewl_callback_call* had a possible segv if the callback type was
	  EWL_CALLBACK_DESTROY and it free'd the widget, but still continued
	  traversing the callback list looking for more functions to execute.
	* Fixed segv in __ewl_text_destroy, etox_free got called even the
	  Ewl_Text hadn't been realized.

Mon Oct  08 02:58:33 2001 Christopher Rosendahl <crosendahl@northernwatch.com>
	* I've fixed known bugs in the cursor behaviour in Ewl_Entry.
	* Re-worked the whole selection algorithm in Ewl_Entry. At the
	  moment it only displays the selection when you select text, it
	  doesn't copy anything to the clip board. I need to think about
	  what more features would be nice to have before i go any further.

Thu Oct  04 06:22:44 2001 Christopher Rosendahl <crosendahl@northernwatch.com>
	* Fixed nasty bug in Ewl_Entry, when you do mouse_down after the
	  text, it would set the cursor pos to be to high, this
	  triggered bug when pressing delete/backspace, which could
	  result in a SEGV.
	* Also made the cursor show up after the text when cursor pos
	  is @ end. Before it didn't show up at all.
	* Fixed memleak in __ewl_entry_delete_to_right.

	  You can turn this on & off in ewl_config.

Wed Oct  03 14:56:33 2001 Christopher Rosendahl <crosendahl@northernwatch.com>
	* Reolved lot's of possible segv's in the Ewl_Table code.          
	  Also made it lay out children correctly, still nedds lots of
	  work, but it's a start.

Wed Oct  03 06:13:14 2001 Christopher Rosendahl <crosendahl@northernwatch.com>
	* Fixed some really unwanted behaviour in the Ewl_Box code.
	  When some of the children with EWL_FILL_POLICY_FILL had a custom
	  size set, it would calculate the size of the other children with
	  that fill policy wrong.

Tue Oct  02 07:13:20 2001 Christopher Rosendahl <crosendahl@northernwatch.com>
	* Made the font cache and image cache spinner in ewl_config

	  a Ewl_Notebook.
	* Made ewl_main_quit only exit the ecore event loop.
	  We don't destroy all widgets or call exit() anymore.

Sun Sep  30 03:38:44 2001 Christopher Rosendahl <crosendahl@northernwatch.com>
	* Added a padd structure to the Ewl_Object.
	* Made the Ewl_Box make use of the new padding in the Ewl_Object, and
	  get rid of the old x_padding/y_padding.
	* If the child had a minimum height that was larger then the Ewl_Box it
	  self, it would resize it to make the children fit. Not any more.
	* Made the Ewl_Separator set its maximum size to the ebits object
	  when realizing it.
	* Same goes for the Ewl_Spinner & Ewl_Entry.
	* Made Ewl_Image work.
	* When realizing a Ewl_CheckButton with a checked state, it didn't
	  set the Check bit to clicked, fixed.
	* Only check the debug enable checkbutton if its enabled.

	  and apply the changed settings.
	* Added a never ending timer which calls ewl_config_reread_and_apply
	  every 0.5 second.
	* Cleaned up ewl_debug.h.
	* Made the test program use ewl_config_set_* and ewl_config_get_*
	  instead of duplicating code.

Fri Sep  28 20:56:15 2001 Christopher Rosendahl <crosendahl@northernwatch.com>
	* Fixed ewl_config, Needed to create ~/.e/ewl/config if it doesnt exist.
	* Fixed segv in ewl_config when the user config did not exist.
