Fri Feb 27 21:35:00 2004 Nathan Ingersoll <rbdpngn@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Abstracted events away from passing around Ecore events.
	* Improved portability to multiple display types, needs testing.

Thu Jan 22 01:48:00 2004 Nathan Ingersoll <rbdpngn@users.sourceforge.net>
	* I have been negligent in keeping this Changelog up to date.
	* Too much has changed since the last entry to list here.
	* See the CVS history for further details, I will try to be better.

Wed Aug 14 19:39:57 2002 Nathan Ingersoll <ningerso@d.umn.edu>
	* Added a spacer widget for tweaking layout
	* Updated box layout to take padding into consideration
	* Removed getopt files, no need to duplicate such heavyweight files
	  for functionality we don't use.
	* Fixed previous changelog entry to have the correct day of the week.

Mon Aug 12 19:39:57 2002 Nathan Ingersoll <ningerso@d.umn.edu>
	* Shortened theme keys, this will eventually be replaced with keys
	  based on inheritance mapping type strings.
	* Updated API documentation comments.
	* Changed ewl_text_new and ewl_entry_new to take a string argument.
	* Layers are now adjusted in the __ewl_widget_reparent function.

Thu Apr 11 09:38:57 2002 Nathan Ingersoll <ningerso@d.umn.edu>
	* Added a preferred size field to objects, and removed the requested
	  size field. Originally the requested size would be the preferred
	  size, but that detail got lost along the way.
	* Documented large sections of code.
	* Added add, and resize notifiers to the containers, the resize
	  notifier is called when a child's preferred size changes.
	* Expanded the possible fill policies and implemented them within the
	  object sizing functions.
	* ymer started a widget called selectionbook that is essentially a
	  prettier notebook.
	* Worked with ymer to develop an internal menu, this may eventually be
	  the basis for global menus.

Mon Nov 12 20:28:57 2001 Christopher Rosendahl <crosendahl@trustlab.com>
	* Added a Ewl_ScrollBar_Flags enum.
	* Wrote a Ewl_TextArea widget.

Sun Nov 11 23:29:50 2001 Christopher Rosendahl <crosendahl@trustlab.com>
	* Ewl_Scrollbar fixes.
	* Ewl_Seeker cleanups and, i also added two new calls
	  	ewl_seeker_decrease()
		ewl_seeker_increase()
	* Wrote a Ewl_ScrollPane widget.

Sun Nov  11 00:38:40 2001 Christopher Rosendahl <crosendahl@trustlab.com>
	* Now ewl_container_get_child_at_recursive() returns the last
	  container found if no widget with the recursive flag set was found.
	* Ewl_Seeker cleanups.

Sat Nov  10 21:23:10 2001 Christopher Rosendahl <crosendahl@trustlab.com>
	* Added a mouse out ecore event handler, which calls focus out on any
	  widgets in focus (if any).
	* Added two new states to the Ewl_State enum
	  	EWL_STATE_NORMAL,
		EWL_STATE_DISABLED
	  a widget by default allways has the state normal unless you call
	  ewl_widget_disable() on it, this will switch to the state "disabled"
	  in ebits, and prevent it from recieving any events except for
	  configure. Just call ewl_widget_enable() on the widget again to
	  make it normal. I also added matching callbacks for theese.

Sat Nov  10 00:22:08 2001 Christopher Rosendahl <crosendahl@trustlab.com>
	* Removed the Ewl_Widget_Type enum, instead im gonna use the
	  Ewl_Widget->appearance to identify widgets.
	* Added a callback called EWL_CALLBACK_APPEARANCE_CHANGED
	  that gets called when you change the appearance string.
	* Made it the fx code init each widget, and read user set effects from
	  a fx.db and then add them.
	* Wrote a dispatcher system for the fx code which looks if there is
	  similiar effects pending and ques it or adds it right away if it
	  wont interfear with any other pending effects.

Sun Nov  04 22:33:44 2001 Christopher Rosendahl <crosendahl@trustlab.com>
	* Rewrote ewl_fx.* the old ones were only temporary solutions.
	  Effects are now pluginable, this is very basic but still powerful.
	* /theme/author, /theme/licence, /theme/name keys now exist in the
	  default theme database.
	* Ewl_Table now support object alignments.
	* Ewl_Text didn't have entries in the default theme.db, neither
	  a own thmeme_update call.
	* Renamed __ewl_widget_hide to _ewl_widget_hide_fx_clip_box,
	  since all it did was to hide the fx_clip_box.
	* Fixed bug in ewl_config_get_int(). It returned whether or not the
	  value was fetched properly instead of returning the value.
	* Added effects called fade_in, fade_out, and glow.
	* Created a Ewl_Widget_Type enum, and added it to Ewl_Widget, mainly
	  for our fx dispatcher to make use of.
	* Changed the FX page in ewl_config to match the new fx code.
	* Added a ZERO macro.

Wed Oct  24 13:13:00 2001 Christopher Rosendahl <crosendahl@trustlab.com>
	* More Ewl_Table cleanups.
	* Ewl_Spinner was calling atoi when deselecting it instead of atof.

Sun Oct  21 18:24:57 2001 Christopher Rosendahl <crosendahl@trustlab.com>
	* The Ewl_Window now inherits from Ewl_Box.
	* Ewl_Scrollbar cleanups.

Tue Oct  09 09:37:56 2001 Christopher Rosendahl <crosendahl@trustlab.com>
	* Now move to the page after the one removed by
	  ewl_notebook_remove_visible() instead of just jumping to the first
	  page.
	* Made the notebook use its special .bits.db.

Tue Oct  09 07:49:30 2001 Christopher Rosendahl <crosendahl@trustlab.com>
	* When a widget is destroyed it now removes itself from it's parent
	  list of children.
	* It is now possible to remove pages from a Ewl_Notebook.
	* Fixed possible segv in ewl_theme_get_str().
	* ewl_callback_call* had a possible segv if the callback type was
	  EWL_CALLBACK_DESTROY and it free'd the widget, but still continued
	  traversing the callback list looking for more functions to execute.
	* Fixed segv in __ewl_text_destroy, etox_free got called even the
	  Ewl_Text hadn't been realized.

Mon Oct  08 02:58:33 2001 Christopher Rosendahl <crosendahl@trustlab.com>
	* I've fixed known bugs in the cursor behaviour in Ewl_Entry.
	* Re-worked the whole selection algorithm in Ewl_Entry. At the
	  moment it only displays the selection when you select text, it
	  doesn't copy anything to the clip board. I need to think about
	  what more features would be nice to have before i go any further.

Thu Oct  04 06:22:44 2001 Christopher Rosendahl <crosendahl@trustlab.com>
	* Fixed nasty bug in Ewl_Entry, when you do mouse_down after the
	  text, it would set the cursor pos to be to high, this
	  triggered bug when pressing delete/backspace, which could
	  result in a SEGV.
	* Also made the cursor show up after the text when cursor pos
	  is @ end. Before it didn't show up at all.
	* Fixed memleak in __ewl_entry_delete_to_right.

	* Reolved lot's of possible segv's in the Ewl_Table code.          
	  Also made it lay out children correctly, still nedds lots of
	  work, but it's a start.

Wed Oct  03 06:13:14 2001 Christopher Rosendahl <crosendahl@trustlab.com>
	* Fixed some really unwanted behaviour in the Ewl_Box code.
	  When some of the children with EWL_FILL_POLICY_FILL had a custom
	  size set, it would calculate the size of the other children with
	  that fill policy wrong.

Tue Oct  02 07:13:20 2001 Christopher Rosendahl <crosendahl@trustlab.com>
	* Made the font cache and image cache spinner in ewl_config
	  actually display kilobytes.

	  a Ewl_Notebook.
	* Made ewl_main_quit only exit the ecore event loop.
	  We don't destroy all widgets or call exit() anymore.

Sun Sep  30 03:38:44 2001 Christopher Rosendahl <crosendahl@trustlab.com>
	* Added a padd structure to the Ewl_Object.
	* Made the Ewl_Box make use of the new padding in the Ewl_Object, and
	  get rid of the old x_padding/y_padding.
	* If the child had a minimum height that was larger then the Ewl_Box it
	  self, it would resize it to make the children fit. Not any more.
	* Made the Ewl_Separator set its maximum size to the ebits object
	  when realizing it.
	* Same goes for the Ewl_Spinner & Ewl_Entry.
	* Made Ewl_Image work.
	* When realizing a Ewl_CheckButton with a checked state, it didn't
	  set the Check bit to clicked, fixed.
	* Only check the debug enable checkbutton if its enabled.
	* Made the Ewl_Image call evas events on mouse down, mouse up and
	  mouse move when the image is a ebits.

Sat Sep  29 07:37:45 2001 Christopher Rosendahl <crosendahl@trustlab.com>
	* Added a Ewl_Position enum.

	  every 0.5 second.
	* Cleaned up ewl_debug.h.
	* Made the test program use ewl_config_set_* and ewl_config_get_*
	  instead of duplicating code.
