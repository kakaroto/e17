	* Started the ChangeLog
	* Fixed memleak in __ewl_button_theme_update
	* Cleaned up Ewl_Entry to work with the new text widget and add a
	  theme_update callback to it. + some changed in the theme code.
	* Made ewl_theme_data_get return void *, and be a pointer to the data
	  in the hash, this is necessery to be able to return other stuff then
	  strings.
	* I introduced a new bug in the Ewl_Seeker widget when playing working
	  with the Ewl_Button widget, and fixed it.
