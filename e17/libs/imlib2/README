This is the Imlib 2 library - a library that does image file loading and
saving as well as rendering, manipulation, arbitrary polygon support, etc.

It does ALL of these operations FAST. Imlib2 also tries to be highly
intelligent about doing them, so writing naive programs can be done
easily, without sacrificing speed.

This is a complete rewrite over the Imlib 1.x series. The architecture is
more modular, simple, and flexible. See index.html in the doc/ directory
for more information.

For examples of this library in use, seek:
