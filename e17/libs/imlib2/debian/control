Description: Powerful image loading and rendering library

 libXpm that provides many more features with much greater 
 flexibility and speed than standard libraries, including font 
 rasterization, rotation, RGBA space rendering and blending, 
 dynamic binary filters, scripting, and more.

 Imlib2 is not a drop-in replacement for Imlib 1.x.
