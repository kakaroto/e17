Hopefully the reader has not been introduced to the concept of software 
frameworks by web based monsters like Ruby on Rails. Personally I think RoR is
great and my point is that a framework does not necessarily mean large software
libraries. A framework can be seen as library of functions determined by the
similiarity in the profile of the applications that use it. In a framework, 
shorter development time means either more specific profiles or more complex 
library code.

In this section and the following subsections we will develop an application
framework for applications with a specific profile: "A X11 desktop application
that doesn't require any exotic manipulation of its theme or configuration 
files". A list of the tasks the framework must perform follow:

* Configuration (Using Ecore_Config).
    * Initialization and shutdown of the necesary services.
    * Saving configuration changes on exit.
    * Recall the previously saved values on initialzation.
    * Control that the necessary configuration and theme files exist.

* Interface Management
    * Create windows with their properties lifted from a given Edje object.
    * Allocate, load and display Edje objects from a "current" theme file, set
      by the user or a "default" theme file setup by the application developer.

The example application using this framework will be an Edje group viewer, this
application will receive a filename and a group name, it will display them 
inside a viewport managed with a minimap. The last signal emitted by the object
is going to be printed to a given text string. Without further ado, here it is,
the main file::

    #include "../lib/framework.c"
    #include "../lib/viewport.c"
    #include "../lib/minimap.c"
    #include <string.h>
    #include <limits.h>

    int arguments_parse(char path[], char group[], int argc, char **argv);

    int main(int argc, char **argv) {

        Ecore_Evas  *mainWindow = NULL;
        Evas        *mainCanvas = NULL;
        Evas_Coord   width, height;
        Evas_Object *mainLayout, *toView, *viewport, *minimap;
        char         path[PATH_MAX],group[100];

        application_name_set("Plain Edje Viewer");
        if (!simpler_init()) 
            return EXIT_FAILURE;

        if(!arguments_parse(path, group, argc, argv))
            return EXIT_FAILURE;

        mainWindow = simpler_window_new("window/main",NULL);
        if (!mainWindow)
            return EXIT_FAILURE;
        mainCanvas = ecore_evas_get(mainWindow);
        mainLayout = ecore_evas_data_get(mainWindow,"layout");

The precedeing code snippet shows two of the three shortcuts our framework
provides. The first function ``simpler_init`` is used to group all the library
intialization functions along with the configuration initialzation functions.
Following the library initialzation comes ``simpler_window_new`` which is used
to create a window based on values provided by a given Edje group. The group
itself is saved inside the Ecore_Evas canvas wrapper as a data pointer and can
be retrieved with ``ecore_evas_data_get``. As you might notice we use of a
function named ``arguments_parse`` to get the path of the requested file and
group from the array of arguments.

Notice that the call to ``simpler_window_new`` does not have any filename 
attached to it. But how does the application know where to look this group up? 
This is the work of Ecore_Config and we will review how is it used in the next 
section of the book. In any case, the following code snippet show a little more 
Edje related action::

        toView = edje_object_add(mainCanvas);
        edje_object_file_set(toView, path, group);
        edje_object_size_min_calc(toView, &width, &height);
        if(width <= 0)
            ecore_evas_geometry_get(mainWindow, NULL, NULL, &width, NULL);
        if(height <= 0)
            ecore_evas_geometry_get(mainWindow, NULL, NULL, NULL, &height);
        evas_object_resize(toView, width, height);
        evas_object_move(toView,0,0);
        evas_object_show(toView);

        viewport = viewport_add(mainCanvas);
        viewport_theme_set(viewport, simpler_object_add(mainCanvas, "widget.minimap"));
        viewport_target_set(viewport,toView);
        edje_object_part_swallow(mainLayout,"swallow.viewport", viewport);

        minimap = minimap_add(mainCanvas);
        minimap_theme_set(minimap, simpler_object_add(mainCanvas, "widget.minimap"));
        edje_object_part_swallow(mainLayout,"swallow.minimap", minimap);
        minimap_viewport_set(minimap,viewport);

        ecore_main_loop_begin();
    }

You might notice the code snippet is split in three bigger sections. In
these sections we include an Edje object to view, we setup the viewport for the
object and the minimap for the viewport respectively. Since the application is 
going to display a
group of an arbitrary name from an arbitrary file we don't use the shortcut 
functions to load and display the target. But among these know functions 
``ecore_evas_geometry_get`` stands out. This function is used to load the 
current size of the window as the object width or height in case it does not 
have either one.

The following two code sections setup each widget, we won't review the 
internals of these yet. We will explore the function ``simpler_object_add``
that is used to load the theme groups for these widgets. In order to mantain 
our santity (and to save some trees) some additional functions or pieces have
been left out of the book. The complete, commented sources for this framework
and the "Plain Edje Viewer" application can be found in the CVS repository of 
the Enlightenment proyect under ``e17/docs/devwithedje/src``. Rest assured the 
omitted functions wont add much to your knowledege about Edje.
