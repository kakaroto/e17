ABOUT THIS DOCUMENT
-------------------
	
	This is a community document, in the same style
as the popular O'Reilly cookbooks (example: http://cookbooks.oreilly.com/).
Any is free to contribute to this document, and as such is a perpetual
work-in-progress.  The document is split into chapters, each covering
a different component, or set of components, that make up the collective
EFL.  



HOW TO CONTRIBUTE
-----------------

	Jump right in!  Each chapter is made up of recipes.  A 
recipe is in the form of a problem (or task) and solution.
The key to a good recipe, just as a cooking recipe, is to be complete.
Whenever possible or practical you should include complete code
examples, from the pre-processor directives (#include...) to the final
closing bracket, so that inexperienced or new coders aren't confused 
by where your code snippet goes.

DOCBOOK BASICS FOR CONTRIBUTERS
-------------------------------

	This document is formated in DocBook/XML.  Using DocBook
is simple, and I don't intend each author to understand, be
experienced with, or give a rats ass about DocBook itself.  The 
important thing is to concentrate on the content.

	In the xml/ directory are several XML files, which 
are individual chapters of the document.  There is an example
of how to add a recipe below, but lets review the basics of DocBook/XML...

	DocBook comes in a variety of flavors, including SGML
and XML.  We're using XML, which if your new to XML in general, looks
and works very much like HTML.  Unlike HTML, however, you MUST close
each tag, there is no tag in XML which can stand alone without being
closed, so everything is done in open/close pairs.  A <book> is made up
of <chapter>s which are made up of <para>graphs and <section>s, which are
themselves made up of <para>graphs.  Each <section> and <chapter>
can be given a <title>.  Like HTML, certain characters are special
and can not be used literally, so the "&" symbol becomes "&amp;", the
"<" symbol becomes "&lt;", and the ">" symbol becomes "&gt;".

	<chapter>s and <section>s can also contain <figure>s and
<example>s, which are wrappers for a <screen> example or a
<programlisting>, which works similarly to the HTML <pre> tag
to maintain program indentation, etc.  <figure>s and <example>s are 
special because they can have <title>s which are listed in figure index
in the beginning of the book.  <figure>s can also include <graphic>s
for screenshots.  In the img/ directory you can place your graphics
to be included.  Remember that because files in the xml/ directory 
are included into the main DocBook/XML document in the root directory
before being rendered that your references to images should
be in the form "img/my_shot.png", not "../img/my_shot.png".
SVG, JPEG, PNG and other formats can be used in DocBook/XML, but
for portability purposes it is recommended that you confine yourself
to using PNG.

	The framework of the document is in place, therefore
as a contributing author you don't need to concern yourself
with the headers, bookinfo, and chapter formating; you only need
to know how to add a new section to each chapter that will be your
recipe.  There should be 1 new section per recipe.  Sub-sections
for a recipe can be used, but are discouraged.

    Each individual section is written in a separate file to 
allow easier maintenance of the book. Each of these files resides
in a directory related to the chapter in reference. So all ecore
sections are in the ecore directory.

    An individual section has a format as seen below. Once the section
is written an entry needs to be made into the chapter xml file and
an entry into the eflcookbook.xml file.

    Into the eflcookbook.xml file you will need to add something
like:

 <!ENTITY ecore_ipc_intro SYSTEM "xml/ecore/ecore_ipc_intro.xml">

This sets up an XML entity reference to your section. Then into the
chapter file you will add an entry like:
 
 &ecore_ipc_intro;

Where you want the section to appear. The value is the 2nd parameter
to the ENTITY tag above.

	The following is an example of what you would add:

--------------------------------------------------------------------
<section>
<sectioninfo>
 <author>
  <firstname>Ben</firstname>
  <lastname>Rockwood</lastname>
  <email>benr@cuddletech.com</email>

</sectioninfo>

<title>Recipe: Simple Drag-N-Drop</title>
<!-- This is a DocBook/XML comment -->

<para>
This is the first paragraph of the recipe about
how nifty Drag-N-Drop is.
</para>

<example>
<title>EVAS Drag-N-Drop Example</title>
<programlisting>
#include &lt;Evas.h&gt;

int main() {
	int * pCounter;
	int i;

	pCounter = &amp;i;
	// My example.
}
</programlisting>
</example>

<para>
Another paragraph.  Don't forget to replace less-than and greater-than
symbols with the proper &lt;, &amp; and &gt; even in your program listings.
</para>

<figure>
<title>An illustration or screenshot </title>
<graphic format='PNG' align='center' fileref='img/my_image.png' />
</figure>

<para>
Some more stuff.
</para>

<figure>
<title>A figure of textual output</title>
<screen>
benr@nexus6 points_calc$ make
gcc -Wall `ewl-config --libs --cflags`  -lGL point_calc.c -o point_calc
point_calc.c: In function `points_calc':
</screen>
</figure>

</section>
--------------------------------------------------------------------

	You can use as many <para>graphs as you need, and line breaks in the XML 
source, like HTML, are unimportant.  The only place your indentation/line-breaks
will matter is within the <programlisting> or <screen> tags.  I'll point out
putting a slash at the end of a tag will close it at the same time, so
<para /> is functionally the same as <para></para>, as you see in the
<graphic>s tag above.

	Thats it!  Pretty simple.  At least 90% of your recipe will
be in <para>'s, and for the rest just follow the example above. 
Don't bother trying to get fancy with your syntax; simplicity is best.  
Just remember to make sure you close all your tags, and you'll do fine.



CREATING OUTPUT & USING THE MAKEFILE
------------------------------------

	The Makefile included is my own special brew that I use
for various documents that I create.  It relies on the following things
being on your system:

1)  XSLTproc, which is part of the libxslt package (http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/).
	Gentoo users need to emerge "libxslt".
2)  FOP, a PDF/PS renderer from the Apache XML project (http://xml.apache.org/fop/)
	Gentoo users need to emerge "fop-bin".
3) XMLlint, part of the libxml package (http://xmlsoft.org/)
	Gentoo users need to emerge "libxml" and "libxml2".
4) The DocBook Official XSL Style Sheets (1.64.0 as of this writting)
	http://docbook.sourceforge.net/projects/xsl/
	
5) The DocBook Official DTD  (4.3CR1 as of this writting)
	http://docbook.org/xml/index.html

	Install each of the above and modify the Makefile as needed to
fit your environment.  Gentoo installs of the XSL and DTDs are possible, but 
personally discouraged.

	No help will be provided in getting PDF or HTML
	output to build properly.  This document will 
	regularly be rendered for the website, etc.
