<title>Recipe: Key Binds, using EVAS Key Events</title>

<para>
Many applications can benifit from providing key binds for commonly used
operations.  Whether accepting text in ways the EFL doesn't normally expect
or just a way to bind the + key to raise the volume of a mixer, keybinds
can add just the bit of functionality that makes your app a hit.
</para>

<para>
The following code is a simple and complete application that is useful
in exploring keybinds using EVAS event callbacks.  It creates a black
100 by 100 pixel window in which you can hit keys.
</para>

<example>
<title>Key grabbing using EVAS Events</title>
<programlisting>
#include &lt;Ecore_Evas.h&gt;
#include &lt;Ecore.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

#define WIDTH 100
#define HEIGHT 100

Ecore_Evas  *   ee;
Evas        *   evas;
Evas_Object *   base_rect;

static int main_signal_exit(void *data, int ev_type, void *ev)
{
        ecore_main_loop_quit();
        return 1;
}

void key_down(void *data, Evas *e, Evas_Object *obj, void *event_info) 
{
        Evas_Event_Key_Down *ev;

        ev = (Evas_Event_Key_Down *)event_info;
        printf("You hit key: %s\n", ev->keyname);
}

int main()
{
        ecore_init();
	ecore_evas_init();

        ecore_event_handler_add(ECORE_EVENT_SIGNAL_EXIT, 
			main_signal_exit, NULL);

        ee = ecore_evas_software_x11_new(NULL, 0,  0, 0, WIDTH, HEIGHT);
        ecore_evas_title_set(ee, "EVAS KeyBind Example");
        ecore_evas_borderless_set(ee, 0);
        ecore_evas_show(ee);

        evas = ecore_evas_get(ee);

        base_rect = evas_object_rectangle_add(evas);
        evas_object_resize(base_rect, WIDTH, HEIGHT);
        evas_object_color_set(base_rect, 0, 0, 0, 255);
        evas_object_focus_set(base_rect, 1);
        evas_object_show(base_rect);

        evas_object_event_callback_add(base_rect, 
			EVAS_CALLBACK_KEY_DOWN, key_down, NULL);      

        ecore_main_loop_begin();
        
        ecore_evas_shutdown();
        ecore_shutdown();

        return 0;
}
</programlisting>
</example>

<para>
You can compile this example in the following manner:
</para>

<example>
<title>EVAS Keybind Compile</title>
<programlisting>
gcc `pkg-config --libs --cflags evas ecore ecore-evas` \
> key_test.c -o key_test
</programlisting>
</example>

<para>
In this example the canvas is setup in the usual way using Ecore_Evas to do the dirty work.
The real magic occurs in the <function>evas_object_event_callback_add()</function> callback.
</para>

<programlisting>
        evas_object_event_callback_add(base_rect,
                        EVAS_CALLBACK_KEY_DOWN, key_down, NULL);
</programlisting>

<para>
By adding a callback to the base_rect, which is acting as the canvas background, we
can execute a function (<function>key_down()</function> in this case) whenever 
we encounter a key down event, defined in <filename>Evas.h</filename> as EVAS_CALLBACK_KEY_DOWN.
</para>

<para>
There is one very important thing to do in addition to defining the callback: setting the focus.
The <function>evas_object_focus_set()</function> function sets the focus on a given Evas object.
It is the object that has focus that will actually accept the events, even though you explicitly
define the Evas object that the callback is attached to.  And only one object can be focused at a time.
The most common problem encountered with Evas callbacks is forgetting to set focus.
</para>

<programlisting>
void key_down(void *data, Evas *e, Evas_Object *obj, void *event_info) 
{
        Evas_Event_Key_Down *ev;

        ev = (Evas_Event_Key_Down *)event_info;
        printf("You hit key: %s\n", ev->keyname);
}
</programlisting>

<para>
The <function>key_down()</function> function is called anytime a key down event occurs
after defining it's callback.  The function declaration is that of a standard Evas
callback (see <filename>Evas.h</filename>).  The important piece of information
we need to know is what key was pressed, which is contained in the Evas <varname>event_info</varname>
structure.  After setting up the <varname>Evas_Event_Key_Down</varname> structure for use as seen 
above we can access the element <varname>keyname</varname> to determine which key was 
pressed.
</para>

<para>
In most cases you'll likely use a <function>switch</function> or nested <function>if</function>'s  to
define which keys do what, and it's recommended that this functionality be paired with
an configuration EDB to provide centralization and easy expansion of your applications keybind settings.
