EWL works in a similar fashion to other widget libraries, being
based on a callback system. As elements are created and added to the 
interface, any desired event callbacks are registered, these functions
will be triggered when the specified event happens.

This tutorial is an attempt to familarize the user with the different
aspects of the EWL system. The tutorial will probably never completely
document all aspects of EWL as the system continues to grow. A good
understanding of C programming is assumed throughout the tutorial.

in general, any feedback is grealy appreciated as it would help improve either
the tutorial or EWL itself. Please see <link linkend="ch-Contributing">Contributing</link>
