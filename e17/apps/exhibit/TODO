TODO:

+ sorting
- click on image to change
+ wheel changing / zooming
- dnd
- options
+ fix .spec file
+ make argv work with /path/to/image.png and not only /path/to/dir
- wallpaper setting - center, stretch, tile
- andy's comments feature

BUGS:

- fix autocomplete
- if we're scrolled to the end of the dir tree, clicking on a dir needs to
  reset the scrollbar to the top.
- if we're looking at a LOT of images and change dir before they have
  finished loading, then the images will thumbnail and load in the current dir
