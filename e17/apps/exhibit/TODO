=======
* BUGS:
=======
+ when rotating images and saving it doesnt update in the thumb listing.
- when sorting on name right after adding a new image it doesnt sort correct.
- fix autocomplete (combobox?)
+ if we're looking at a LOT of images and change dir before they have
  finished loading, then the images will thumbnail and load in the current dir
  
+ if we're scrolled to the end of the dir tree, clicking on a dir needs to
  reset the scrollbar to the top.
