* implement file information retrieval, with results
  similar to that of file(1), ideally with i18n.

* implement a comprehensive test suite.

* File types have a bug that under some circumstances
  produce the result document/unknown instead of the
  correct one. Bug in the MF heuristic?

* Issues with monitoring of single files? imon?

* Update efsd_misc_get_user_dir() to also use getpwuid()
  instead of getenv("HOME").
