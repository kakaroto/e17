    <title>&lefsd; - The Client Side of EFSD</title>
    <section>
      <title>Preliminaries</title>
      <para>
	The way applications talk to &efsd; is through
	&lefsd;. &lefsd; handles
	all the dirty low-level work (such as sending of commands and
	receiving of replies) and provides a convenient API to the clients.
	The following sections will briefly introduce general concepts
	before the API is explained in detail.
      </para>
      <section>
	<title>Sending Commands</title>
	<para>
	  Before you can launch any commands, you need to establish a
	  connection to &efsd; via <link linkend="API-efsd-open">
	    <function>efsd_open()</function></link>. The returned
	  <function>EfsdConnection</function> pointer id used to identify
	  the connection and is passed as first parameter to basically every
	  function. When you're done, you can tear down the connection
	  and release the allocated memory using <link linkend="API-efsd-close">
	    <function>efsd_close()</function></link>.
	</para>
	<para>
	  You can send commands for the following tasks:

	  <itemizedlist mark="opencircle">
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Creating symbolic links (<function>ln -s</function>)</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Listing directory contents (<function>ls</function>)</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Copying, moving, removing files (<function>cp</function>,
		<function>mv</function>, <function>rm</function>)</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Creating directories (<function>mkdir</function>)</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Setting permissions (<function>chmod</function>)</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Setting and getting metadata</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Getting filetype information</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Getting the destination of a link (<function>readlink</function>)</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para><function>stat</function> and <function>lstat</function></para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>File monitoring</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>
	  
	  When a command is sent to the server, you get a command id in
	  return, which is guaranteed to be unique, and can therefore be
	  used to associate replies from &efsd; and
	  sent commands. The exception is the unlikely case that the
	  write buffer from the client to the server does not have enough
	  room for the command, in this case a value &lt; 0 is returned.
	  This is rather unlikely, however, robust code should always
	  check the result like this:

	  <programlisting>

EfsdConnection *ec = efsd_open();
EfsdCmdId id;

if ( (id = efsd_makedir(ec, "foo/bar")) < 0)
  {
     /* Could not send command. Continue accordingly. */
  }
	  </programlisting>

	  Otherwise the receiving part of your client may be waiting for
	  a reply to a command that never got sent to &efsd;. &efsd; does
	  not queue those requests on the client side, as the urgency of
	  the commands depends on the application setting. For some scenarios,
	  queueing may be appropriate, while for others, simply discarding
	  the command may be better. The decision is left to the client.
	</para>
      </section>
      <section>
	<title>Passing Command Options</title>
	<para>
	  Many of the most commonly used commands at the command line use
	  options, think of <function>ls -la</function>, <function>mkdir -p</function>
	  etc. &lefsd; provides a flexible way of
	  combining options for the same purpose.
	</para>
	<para>
	  There are two conceivable situations when you encounter the need
	  for options:

	  <itemizedlist mark="opencircle">
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Static combinations of options, known at compile time.</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Dynamic combinations of options, unknown at compile time.</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>
	  
	  Consequently, &lefsd; provides two means for plugging options together. All
          options are constructed using the <function>efsd_op_XXX()</function> calls. For
	  the static case, there's the <link linkend="API-efsd-ops"><function>efsd_ops()
	  </function></link> function, which is variadic. You pass it the number of options
          you are using, and then call the needed option constructors. An example:

	  <programlisting>  
EfsdConnection *ec;
EfsdOptions *ops;

/* Connection setup, etc. */

/* Assemble an EfsdOptions object, containing 2 options:
 * one to list all files (as in ls -a), and one to request
 * alphabetical sorting of the listed files.
 */

ops = efsd_ops(2, efsd_op_list_all(), efsd_op_sort());

/* Now simply pass ops along with the command: */

if ( (id = efsd_listdir(ec, "foo/bar", ops)) < 0)
  {
     /* Could not send command. Continue accordingly. */
  }
	  </programlisting>

	  <caution>
	    <title>You do not need to <function>free()</function>the options.</title>
            <para>
              The <classname>EfsdOptions</classname> are deallocated by the time
              the efsd command returns.
            </para>
	  </caution>
	</para>

  <chapter id="efsdshell">
    <title>&efsdsh; - An Interactive &efsd; Client</title>
    <para>    	     
      The &efsd; distribution comes with a useful tool for testing and playing with &efsd;
      -- that's &efsdsh;, the &efsd; shell <footnote><para>"Shell" is a bit of exageration, since &efsdsh;
      provides only a small subset of a real shell's functionality.</para></footnote>. It provides
      a simplified command line prompt, where you can send commands to &efsd; in the usual fashion, i.e.
      a directory copy command is <function>cp -r /some/dir /some/other/dir</function> etc.
      Enter <function>help</function> at the prompt to get an overview of the available commands and
      options.
    </para>
    <para>
      Besides being useful for testing &efsd; commands, &efsdsh; is also great for testing &efsd;'s
      behaviour when handling multiple clients - just launch a bunch of &efsdsh;s and watch how
      file monitoring requests are answered in a few of them etc.
    </para>
    <para>
      Notice that &efsd; must be running when starting &efsdsh;, it does not do that for you.
