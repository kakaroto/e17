      This is the manual for &efsd;, the Enlightenment File System Daemon.
      The purpose of &efsd; is to provide a facility that allows applications
      to issue commands on filesystems (such as the familiar <command>cp</command>,
      <command>mv</command> and <command>rm</command>, but much more than that)
      in a non-blocking fashion
      and get reports on the outcome of those commands asynchronously.

      I'd like to thank Raster <email>raster@rasterman.com</email> for talking
      me into writing &efsd; during one of our dinner sessions somewhere in San
      Francisco in late 2000. I've had and am still having a blast working on it.
      I'd also like to thank the various people who have contributed suggestions,
      feedback and patches. Their names can always be found in the

      <title>Using &efsd; in Your Application</title>
      <para>
	What is usually referred to as &efsd; actually comes in two parts -
        the &efsd; server daemon and a library to be used by the clients, called
        &lefsd;. When referring to the software package &efsd;, the combination
        of both the server and the library is meant. Context should make clear
	what is referred to.
      </para>
      <para>
        To enable your application to use &efsd;, all you have to
        do is link your application against &lefsd;. In the tradition of
	the various configuration scripts that lots of software packages
	are providing now (think of <command>gtk-config</command>,
	<command>gnome-config</command> etc), &efsd; has
        <command>efsd-config</command>, which reports the necessary compilation
        and linkage flags.
      </para>
      <para>
        When running your application, the &efsd; daemon must be up and running.
        You can do this by simply issuing the <command>efsd</command> command (see
        <command>efsd --help</command> for the available options), or your
        application can launch it for you (although it should do so only after
        making sure that an &efsd; instance isn't already running).
      </para>
      <para>
        &efsd; has only few requirements. Right now they are

    <title id="libefsd.title">&lefsd; - The Client Side of &efsd;</title>
    <section>
      <title>Using &lefsd;</title>
      <para>
	The way applications talk to &efsd; is through
	&lefsd;. &lefsd; handles
	all the dirty low-level work (such as the I/O details of sending commands
	and receiving replies) and provides a convenient API to the clients.
	The following sections will briefly introduce general concepts
	before the API is explained in detail.
      </para>
      <section>
	<title>Opening a Connection to &efsd;</title>
	<para>
	  Before you can launch any commands, you need to establish a
	  connection to &efsd; via <link linkend="API-efsd-open">
	    <function>efsd_open()</function></link>. The returned
	  &efsd; pointer is used to identify the connection and is passed as
	  first parameter to basically every function. When you're done, you can tear down the connection
	  and release the allocated memory using <link linkend="API-efsd-close">
	    <function>efsd_close()</function></link>.
	  <programlisting>

EfsdConnection *ec;

if ( (ec = efsd_open()) == NULL)
  {
     /* Oops. Couldn't establish connection.
      * Is Efsd really running ? 
      */
  }
	  </programlisting>
	</para>
      </section>
      <section>
	<title>Sending Commands</title>
	<para>
	  After opening a connection, the client is ready to launch commands.
	  You can send commands for the following tasks:

	  <itemizedlist mark="opencircle">
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Creating symbolic links (<function>ln -s</function>)</para>

	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>File monitoring</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>
	  
	  When a command is sent to the server, you get a command ID in
	  return, which is guaranteed to be unique, and can therefore be
	  used to associate replies from &efsd; and
	  sent commands. The exception is the unlikely case that the
	  write buffer from the client to the server does not have enough
	  room for the command, in this case a value &lt; 0 is returned.
	  This is rather unlikely, however, robust code should always
	  check the result like this:

	  <programlisting>

EfsdConnection *ec;
EfsdCmdId id;

if ( (ec = efsd_open()) == NULL)
  {
     /* Oops. Couldn't establish connection.
      * Is Efsd really running ?
      */
  }

if ( (id = efsd_makedir(ec, "foo/bar")) < 0)
  {
     /* Could not send command. Continue accordingly. */
  }
	  </programlisting>

	  <note>
	    <title>A return value &lt; 0 does not mean that an error occured when processing the command.</title>
	    <para>
	      It means that the command didn't get sent to the server in the
	      first place. Errors during actual execution of the commands are
	      reported as error codes in the returned replies.
	    </para>
	  </note>

	  If you don't check the return value, the receiving part of your client
	  may be waiting for reply to a command that never got sent to &efsd;.
	  &efsd; does not queue those requests on the client side, as the urgency of
	  the commands depends on the application setting. For some scenarios,
	  queueing may be appropriate, while for others, simply discarding
	  the command may be better. The decision is left to the client.

      <section>
	<title>Passing Command Options</title>
	<para>
	  Many of the most commonly used commands at the command line use
	  options, think of <command>ls -la</command>, <command>mkdir -p</command>
	  etc. &lefsd; provides a flexible way of combining options for the same purpose.
          Also, the ability to pass options can be a great performance
          improvement: consider the case where monitoring a large directory is requested.
          Chances are that an application will need to initialize data structures
          according to the various <constant>EFSD_FILE_EXISTS</constant> events, and
          that the application will send further commands to &efsd; based on those events.
          By requesting those actions to be taken by passing a single option to the original
          file monitoring request, the communication overhead can be drastically reduced,
          because the request is sent only once, instead of once <emphasis>per
          received <constant>EFSD_FILE_EXISTS</constant> event</emphasis>.
	</para>
	<para>
	  There are two conceivable situations when you encounter the need
	  for options:

	  <itemizedlist mark="opencircle">
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Static combinations of options, known at compile time.</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Dynamic combinations of options, unknown at compile time.</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>
	  
	  Consequently, &lefsd; provides two means for plugging options together. All
          options are constructed using the <function>efsd_op_XXX()</function> calls. For
	  the static case, there's the <link linkend="API-efsd-ops"><function>efsd_ops()
	  </function></link> function, which is variadic. You pass it the number of options
          you are using, and then call the needed option constructors. An example:

	  <programlisting>  
EfsdConnection *ec;
EfsdCmdId id;
EfsdOptions *ops;

/* Connection setup, etc. */

/* Assemble an EfsdOptions object, containing 2 options:
 * one to list all files (as in ls -a), and one to request
 * alphabetical sorting of the listed files.
 */

ops = efsd_ops(2, efsd_op_list_all(), efsd_op_sort());

/* Now simply pass ops along with the command: */

if ( (id = efsd_listdir(ec, "foo/bar", ops)) < 0)
  {
     /* Could not send command. Continue accordingly. */
  }
	  </programlisting>

	  <caution>
	    <title>You do not need to <function>free()</function> the options.</title>
            <para>
              The <classname>EfsdOptions</classname> are already deallocated by the time
              the &efsd; command returns.
            </para>
	  </caution>

	  The other case is when you need to assemble options dynamically, at runtime
	  <footnote><para><link linkend="efsdshell">&efsdsh;</link> is an example of an application
          where this happens.</para></footnote>. Just create an <classname>EfsdOptions</classname>
          object using <function>efsd_ops_create()</function>, and then add options created via
          <function>efsd_op_XXX()</function> using <function>efsd_ops_add()</function>.

	  <programlisting>  
EfsdConnection *ec;
EfsdCmdId id;
EfsdOptions *ops;
int show_all, get_stat, get_type, sort;

/* Connection setup, etc. */

/* Determine which options are needed (I assume here
 * that there's at least one), and set the corresponding
 * flags (show_all, get_stat etc).
*/

ops = efsd_ops_create();

if (show_all) efsd_ops_add(ops, efsd_op_list_all());
if (get_stat) efsd_ops_add(ops, efsd_op_get_stat());
if (get_type) efsd_ops_add(ops, efsd_op_get_filetype());
if (sort)     efsd_ops_add(ops, efsd_op_sort());

if ( (id = efsd_start_monitor_dir(ec, "/some/dir", ops)) < 0)
  {
     /* Could not send command. Continue accordingly. */
  }
	  </programlisting>

        When using options on a file monitoring request (like <link linkend="API-efsd-start-monitor-dir">
        <function>efsd_start_monitor_dir()</function></link>), you are guaranteed to receive
        the <constant>EFSD_FILE_EXISTS</constant> events before any results of options applied
	to the files that are covered by the monitor. You can <emphasis>not</emphasis>, however,
        rely on receiving the <constant>EFSD_FILE_EXISTS</constant> events and all the results
	generated through the options before receiving the <constant>EFSD_FILE_EXISTS</constant>
        event for the next file, or on any sequence in which those results arrive. The reason
        is that the actions requested by the options take varying amounts of time and
        &efsd; processes those actions in parallel. See
        <link linkend="multithreading" endterm="multithreading.title"></link> for details.

	are missing:

    <para>    	     
      The &efsd; distribution comes with a useful tool for testing and playing with &efsd;
      -- that's &efsdsh;, the &efsd; shell <footnote><para>"Shell" is a bit of exageration, since &efsdsh;
      provides only a small subset of a real shell's functionality.</para></footnote>. It provides
      a simplified command line prompt, where you can send commands to &efsd; in the usual fashion, i.e.
      a directory copy command is <function>cp -r /some/dir /some/other/dir</function> etc.
      Enter <function>help</function> at the prompt to get an overview of the available commands and
      options.
    </para>
    <para>
      Besides being useful for testing &efsd; commands, &efsdsh; is also great for testing &efsd;'s
      behaviour when handling multiple clients - just launch a bunch of &efsdsh;s and watch how
      file monitoring requests are answered in a few of them etc.
    </para>
    <para>
      Notice that &efsd; must be running when starting &efsdsh;, it does not do that for you.
