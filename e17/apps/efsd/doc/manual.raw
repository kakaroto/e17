      This is the manual for &efsd;, the Enlightenment File System Daemon.
      The purpose of &efsd; is to provide a facility that allows applications
      to issue commands on filesystems (such as the familiar <command>cp</command>,
      <command>mv</command> and <command>rm</command>, but much more than that)
      in a non-blocking fashion
      and get reports on the outcome of those commands asynchronously.

      I'd like to thank Raster <email>raster@rasterman.com</email> for talking
      me into writing &efsd; during one of our dinner sessions somewhere in San
      Francisco in late 2000. I've had and am still having a blast working on it.
      I'd also like to thank the various people who have contributed suggestions,
      feedback and patches. Their names can always be found in the

      <para>
	Assume the following situation: you're writing an application that needs
	to perform typical filesystem-related tasks, possibly multiple ones at the
	same time, such as copying or moving files (see the list of commands in
	Section <link linkend="sending-commands" endterm="sending-commands.title"></link>)
	which may consume a lot of time. Additionally, the application needs to
	stay responsive to user input and/or other events while these commands
	are executed.	
      </para>
      <para>
	A possible solution is to code the needed functionality and make it run in
	separate threads. This is both a duplication of effort and can also quickly
	become nontrivial from a synchronization point of view.
      </para>
      <para>
	Enter &efsd;. &efsd gives you all the functionality mentioned above,
	accessible through a simple API, in an efficient, parallelized implementation.
	&efsd; integrates many commonly needed filesystem commands in one software
	package. See Section <link linkend="using-efsd" endterm="using-efsd.title"></link>
	for details about enabling your application to use &efsd; and Section
	<link linkend="efsd-arch" endterm="efsd-arch.title"></link> to get an
	idea about the way &efsd works.

    </section>
    <section id="using-efsd">
      <title id="using-efsd.title">Using &efsd; in Your Application</title>
      <para>
	What is usually referred to as &efsd; actually comes in two parts -
        the &efsd; server daemon and a library to be used by the clients, called
        &lefsd;. When referring to the software package &efsd;, the combination
        of both the server and the library is meant. Context should make clear
	what is referred to.
      </para>
      <para>
        To enable your application to use &efsd;, all you have to
        do is link your application against &lefsd;. In the tradition of
	the various configuration scripts that lots of software packages
	are providing now (think of <command>gtk-config</command>,
	<command>gnome-config</command> etc), &efsd; has
        <command>efsd-config</command>, which reports the necessary compilation
        and linkage flags.
      </para>
      <para>
        When running your application, the &efsd; daemon must be up and running.
        You can do this by simply issuing the <command>efsd</command> command (see
        <command>efsd --help</command> for the available options), or your
        application can launch it for you (although it should do so only after
        making sure that an &efsd; instance isn't already running).

        As can be seen above, multiple clients talk to &efsd; through &lefsd;. &efsd; in turn
	is composed of a number of subsystems which handle command-specific tasks, accessing the
	filesystem through system calls as well as <function>libfam</function> and <function>FAM</function>,

      </para>

      <para>
	To use &efsd;, applications establish a communication channel with &efsd
	using &lefsd;.  Using this connection, they then send commands to the
	daemon, which starts to execute them upon reception. When execution is
	finished, a reply containing details such as the result of the operation
        is asynchronously sent back to the client application, which was able
	to continue work on other outstanding tasks in the meantime.

    <section>
      <title>Using &lefsd;</title>
      <para>
	The way applications talk to &efsd; is through
	&lefsd;. &lefsd; handles
	all the dirty low-level work (such as the I/O details of sending commands
	and receiving replies) and provides a convenient API to the clients.
	The following sections introduce general concepts before the API is
	explained in detail.

	  <title>This chapter tells you all you'll need to know in order to use
	    use the &lefsd; API.</title>
	  <para>
	    The next chapter gives additional information about the server itself,
	    but that information is not strictly necessary in order to be able
	    to use &efsd;, except maybe for the command line options when launching
	    the server.

      <section>
	<title>Opening a Connection to &efsd;</title>
	<para>
	  Before you can launch any commands, you need to establish a
	  connection to &efsd; via <link linkend="API-efsd-open">
	    <function>efsd_open()</function></link>. The returned
	  &efsd; pointer is used to identify the connection and is passed as
	  first parameter to basically every function. When you're done, you can tear down the connection
	  and release the allocated memory using <link linkend="API-efsd-close">
	    <function>efsd_close()</function></link>.
	  <programlisting>

EfsdConnection *ec;

if ( (ec = efsd_open()) == NULL)
  {
     /* Oops. Couldn't establish connection.
      * Is Efsd really running ? 
      */
  }

/* ... various efsd commands ... */

	  When a command is sent to the server, you get a (non-negative) command ID in
	  return, which is guaranteed to be unique, and can therefore be
	  used to associate replies from &efsd; and
	  sent commands. The exception is the unlikely case that the
	  write buffer from the client to the server does not have enough
	  room for the command, in this case a value &lt; 0 is returned.
	  This is rather unlikely, however, robust code should always
	  check the result like this:

	  <programlisting>

EfsdConnection *ec;
EfsdCmdId id;

if ( (ec = efsd_open()) == NULL)
  {
     /* Oops. Couldn't establish connection.
      * Is Efsd really running ?
      */
  }

if ( (id = efsd_makedir(ec, "foo/bar")) < 0)
  {
     /* Could not send command. Continue accordingly. */
  }
	  </programlisting>

	  <note>
	    <title>A return value &lt; 0 does not mean that an error occurred when processing the command.</title>
	    <para>
	      It means that the command didn't get sent to the server in the
	      first place. Errors during actual execution of the commands are
	      reported as error codes in the returned replies.
	    </para>
	  </note>
	</para>	
	<para><
	  If you don't check the return value, the receiving part of your client
	  may be waiting for reply to a command that never got sent to &efsd;.
	</para>
	<para>
	  When clients send bursts of commands, it can happen that &efsd; is busy
	  processing commands and cannot keep up with the commands being sent to
	  the server. When this happens, commands are queued on the client side.
	    &lefsd; offers two calls to handle the client-side command queues:
	  <link linkend="API-efsd-commands-pending"><function>efsd_commands_pending()</function></link>,
	  which reports whether or not commands are currently queued, and 
	  <link linkend="API-efsd-flush"><function>efsd_flush()</function></link>,
          which sends as many queued commands to the client as possible.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The queue is also processed whenever a command is written to the server,
	  so the command sequence always remains intact.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The ideal way to manually flush the queue (in case there is one), is to
	  get the &efsd; connection file descriptor using
	  <link linkend="API-efsd-get-connection-fd"><function>efsd_get_connection_fd()</function></link>,
	  then to use <function>select()</function> on the file descriptor to
	  find out when it becomes writeable, and then flush the queue.
	</para>
      </section>
      
      <section>
	<title>Receiving Events</title>
        <para>
	  There are two basic ways of receiving events from &efsd; in your client:
	  Using <function>select()</function> to wait on events on file descriptors,
	  or using &lefsd;'s convenience functions which block and wait until events
	  arrive.
        </para>
	<section>
	  <title>Using <function>select()</function> and File Descriptors</title>
          <para>
	  This is the more sophisticated and flexible way, well-suited for complex
	  event loops. Use <link linkend="API-efsd-get-connection-fd"><function>
	  efsd_get_connection_fd()</function></link> to get the connection's file
	  descriptor. You can then <function>ioctl()</function> this descriptor to
	  enable e.g. nonblocking mode, then use <function>select()</function> as
	  usual. If you're not familiar with <function>select()</function>, have a
	  look at <link linkend="bib-apue"><citation>Stevens 1998</citation></link> or
	  <link linkend="bib-unp"><citation>Stevens 1992</citation></link>.
          </para>
	  <para>
	    The code in this case then usually looks like this:

	  <programlisting>  
EfsdConnection *ec;
fd_set          fdset;
int             fd, fdsize = 0;

if ( (ec = efsd_open()) == NULL)
  {
     /* Oops. Couldn't establish connection.
      * Is Efsd really running ?
      */
  }

fd = efsd_get_connection_fd(ec);

FD_ZERO(&amp;fdset);

/* Set desired filedescriptors here, also maybe
 * create other fd_sets ...
 */

/* ... */

FD_SET(fd, &amp;fdset);
if (fd > fdsize)
  fdsize = fd;

select(fdsize + 1, &amp;fdset, NULL, NULL, NULL);

/* Check for events on Efsd's descriptor */

if (FD_ISSET(fd, &amp;fdset))
  {	  
    EfsdEvent ee;

    /* Efsd events have arrived -- now loop while
     * there are events pending in the arrival queue.
     */
   
    while (efsd_events_pending(ec))
      {
	 if (efsd_next_event(ec, &amp;ee) >= 0)
           {
              /* Handle the event */
	      /* ... */

              /* Now clean up: */
              efsd_event_cleanup(&amp;ee);
           }
	 else
           {
              /* Error while reading event. */
           }
      }
  }
	    </programlisting>
	    After adding the file descriptors to an <classname>fd_set</classname>,
            you <function>select()</function> the <classname>fd_set</classname>
            and check &efsd;'s file descriptor when <function>select()</function> returns.
	    One or more &efsd; events may have arrived. To read them, loop while
	    <link linkend="API-efsd-events-pending"><function>efsd_events_pending()
	    </function></link> returns a value greater than zero. You read the event
            into an <classname>EfsdEvent</classname> structure.

	  <caution>
	    <title>After you finished handling the event, you need to clean up the structure.</title>
            <para>
              Use <link linkend="API-efsd-event-cleanup"><function>efsd_event_cleanup()</function></link>
              to release any memory that was read into the <classname>EfsdEvent</classname> structure.
            </para>
	  </caution>
	  </para>
        </section>
	<section>
	  <title>Using &lefsd; and Blocking Waits</title>
          <para>
	    When you're not using complex event loops, a simpler way is to use
	    &lefsd;'s convenience functions for reading &efsd; events. The code
	    looks like this:

	  <programlisting>  
EfsdConnection *ec;
EfsdEvent ee;

if ( (ec = efsd_open()) == NULL)
  {
     /* Oops. Couldn't establish connection.
      * Is Efsd really running ?
      */
  }

while (efsd_wait_event(ec, &amp;ee) >= 0)
  {
     /* Handle the event */
     /* ... */

     /* Now clean up: */
     efsd_event_cleanup(&amp;ee);
  }
	  </programlisting>

	    After establishing the connection to &efsd; your event handler simply
            sits in a loop that calls <link linkend="API-efsd-wait-event">
	    <function>efsd_wait_event()</function></link> and blocks until an event
	    arrives . As before, after handling the event,
	    you need to clean up using <link linkend="API-efsd-event-cleanup"><function>
            efsd_event_cleanup()</function></link>.
          </para>
        </section>

	<section id="eventtypes">
	  <title id="eventtypes.title">Handling Event Types</title>
          <para>
	There are two kinds of reply events that you can receive:

	  <itemizedlist mark="opencircle">
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
                <emphasis>Reply Events</emphasis>, which report the result of a

	<title id="monitoring.title">Monitoring and Listing Files</title>
	<para>
	  &efsd; allows you to <emphasis>monitor</emphasis> files and directories.
          Monitoring means that your client is notified when files are modified,
          created or removed. You can monitor both single files or entire directories.
	  As described when the <constant>EFSD_FILE_EXIST</constant> event type was
	  introduced, <constant>EFSD_FILE_EXISTS</constant> events are received when a file
          monitor is started, whereas a directory monitor generates <constant>EFSD_FILE_EXISTS
	  </constant> events for every file in the directory. Note that by default,
	  hidden files (starting with a dot) are excluded.

	  <caution>
	    <title> When you monitor a directory as a file, you get <emphasis>no</emphasis>
	      monitoring events when a file in the directory changed.</title>
            <para>
            </para>
	  </caution>
	</para>
	<para>
	  To request monitoring of a file or directory, use <link linkend="API-efsd-start-monitor">
	  <function>efsd_start_monitor()</function></link>, for stopping a monitor, use
	  <link linkend="API-efsd-stop-monitor"><function>efsd_stop_monitor()</function></link>.
	  Make sure you understand the meaning of the various file monitoring events that can occur,
	  recall the section on <link linkend="eventtypes" endterm="eventtypes.title"></link>.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The same event-based technique for getting the directory contents can also be
	  used to just get a directory listing, using <link linkend="API-efsd-listdir">
          <function>efsd_listdir()</function></link>. It causes <constant>EFSD_FILE_EXIST</constant>
	  events to be sent to the requesting client just like when a full monitor is
	  requested. You do not, however, get events when files in the directory are
	  changed afterwards.
	</para> 
	<para>
	  Because a directory monitor and a directory listing potentially cause a lot of
	  communication traffic (for all the <constant>EFSD_FILE_EXIST</constant> events),
	  it is a good idea to consider passing options along with the command, that launch other commands
	  on every reported file. See <link linkend="options" endterm="options.title"></link>

        <title>Setting and Retrieving File Metadata</title>
          <para>
	  There are a lot of scenarios where it can be useful to attach arbitrary data
	  to a file. Think of coordinates for a file's icon in a file manager etc. In
	  fact, most operating systems already store such <emphasis>metadata</emphasis>
	  for each file, such as modification times, file permissions etc. The problem
	  is that this information is fixed and doesn't allow a user program to attach
	  arbitrary data <footnote><para>Apparently there is a Linux kernel patch in
	  the works that will allow this.</para></footnote>. Whether or not you're
	  using Linux, &efsd; allows you to associate arbitrary information with a file.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	  The API for setting and retrieving file metadata is simple. Every chunk of
	  metadata is identified through a <emphasis>key</emphasis>, which is a simple
	  character string. When setting metadata, you can choose among four types of
	  data:
	  
	  <itemizedlist mark="opencircle">
	    <listitem>
	      <para><constant>EFSD_INT</constant>: integer data.</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para><constant>EFSD_FLOAT</constant>: floating-point data.</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para><constant>EFSD_STRING</constant>: character string data.</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para><constant>EFSD_RAW</constant>: raw binary data.</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>

	  &lefsd;'s API provides one function for each of these data types, those calls are
	  <link linkend="API-efsd-set-metadata-int"><function>efsd_set_metadata_int()</function></link>,
	  <link linkend="API-efsd-set-metadata-float"><function>efsd_set_metadata_float()</function></link>,
	  <link linkend="API-efsd-set-metadata-str"><function>efsd_set_metadata_sir()</function></link> and
	  <link linkend="API-efsd-set-metadata-raw"><function>efsd_set_metadata_raw()</function></link>.
	  Those functions should be self-explanatory. When using <link linkend="API-efsd-set-metadata-raw">
	  <function>efsd_set_metadata_raw()</function></link>, you need to pass the type of the data
	  you're setting, also the size of the data chunk in bytes.
          </para>
	  <para>
	  When querying for metadata, use <link linkend="API-efsd-get-metadata"><function>
	  efsd_get_metadata()</function></link>. The client will then get an
	  <classname>EfsdEvent</classname> containing a <classname>EfsdReplyEvent</classname>
	  containing the metadata. You can look up the details of the requested data in
	  them command received along with the reply. To access the type of the metadata
	  and the data itself, &lefsd; provides convenience functions to save you from
	  the tedious traversal of the <classname>EfsdEvent</classname> union. Those are
	  <link linkend="API-efsd-metadata-get-type"><function>efsd_metadata_get_type()</function></link>,
	  <link linkend="API-efsd-metadata-get-int"><function>efsd_metadata_get_int()</function></link>,

	  <link linkend="API-efsd-metadata-get-raw"><function>efsd_metadata_get_raw()</function></link>,

	  <caution>
	    <title> When using <link linkend="API-efsd-metadata-get-str"><function>

	      the string/data you receive.</title>
            <para>
	      This is because you get a copy of the data whenever you request it. Regardless of
	      releasing this memory, you still need to call <link linkend="API-efsd-event-cleanup">
	     <function>efsd_event_cleanup()</function></link> on the reply event itself!

        <title id="filetypes.title">Handling Filetypes</title>
        <para>
	  Oftentimes, an application wants to know details about a file it needs to read or
	  modify. GUI environments frequently create security risks when simplistic
	  mechanisms are used to associate files and applications working on those files.
	  Usually, simple file name patterns are used to take a guess about the type of
	  a file.
	</para>
        <para>
	  The well-known UNIX <command>file</command> command uses a smarter approach: it
	  uses a multi-level approach that examines files, with each level providing less
	  reliable information in case a previous level failed. Roughly, files are scanned
	  on the OS level (examining the result of <function>stat()</function> results) and
	  searched for typical <emphasis>magic</emphasis> bytestrings in order to reliably
	  determine the file's type. See the manpage for more details.
        </para>
        <para>
	  &efsd; uses a similar approach that extends the concept of MIME types from
	  two-level descriptions (such as <emphasis>text/html</emphasis>) to descriptions
          of arbitrary depth. It is then up to the client application to make as much
	  use of the calculated file type as necessary. As an example, a typical reply
	  received when requesting the file type of an MP3 file would be
	  <emphasis>audio/mp3/128-kbit-s/44-1-khz/jstereo</emphasis>.
        </para>
        <para>
	  First &efsd; checks whether the file to examine is an ordinary file. If not,
	  it examines the result of <function>statfs</function> and <function>stat</function>
	  calls and returns a filetype such as <emphasis>dir/ext2</emphasis> or
	  <emphasis>dir/reiserfs</emphasis>. If it is a common readable file, magic
	  tests are performed. If those tests also fail, &efsd; falls back to ordinary
	  filename extension matching. Should those also fail, the default fallback type
          is <emphasis>document/unknown</emphasis>.
	</para>
        <para>
          To request a filetype, use <link linkend="API-efsd-get-filetype"><function>
          efsd_get_filetype()</function></link>. The code pattern is as follows:
	  <programlisting>  
EfsdConnection *ec;
EfsdCmdId id;
EfsdEvent ee;

if ( (ec = efsd_open()) == NULL)
  {
     /* Oops. Couldn't establish connection.
      * Is Efsd really running ?
      */
  }

/* Request the filetype: */

if ( (id = efsd_get_filetype(ec, "/foo/bar")) < 0)
  {
     /* Could not send command. Continue accordingly. */
  }

/* In the event loop, examine the result: */

while (efsd_wait_event(ec, &amp;ee) >= 0)
  {
     /* Handle the event */

     switch (ee.type)
      {
        /* ... */
        case EFSD_EVENT_REPLY:

          switch (ee.efsd_reply_event.command.type)
	   {
	     /* ... */

             case EFSD_CMD_GETFILETYPE:
               if (ee.efsd_reply_event.status == SUCCESS)
	         {
	           printf("Filetype of file %s is %s\n",
                          efsd_reply_filename(&amp;ee),
                          (char*)ee.efsd_reply_event.data);
	         }
	       break;

             /* ... */
           }
	}
  
     /* Cleanup memory allocated for this event */
  
     efsd_event_cleanup(&amp;ee);
  }
	  </programlisting>

	  <caution>
	    <title>Calculating file types is expensive.</title>
            <para>
	      &efsd; potentially has to read many locations in a file and check for magic
	      patterns, which is slow. File type results are cached to improve response times,

      <section id="options">
	<title id="options.title">Passing Command Options</title>
	<para>
	  Many of the most commonly used commands at the command line use
	  options, think of <command>ls -la</command>, <command>mkdir -p</command>
	  etc. &lefsd; provides a flexible way of combining options for the same purpose.
          Also, the ability to pass options can be a great performance
          improvement: consider the case where monitoring a large directory is requested.
          Chances are that an application will need to initialize data structures
          according to the various <constant>EFSD_FILE_EXISTS</constant> events, and
          that the application will send further commands to &efsd; based on those events.
          By requesting those actions to be taken by passing a single option to the original
          file monitoring request, the communication overhead can be drastically reduced,
          because the request is sent only once, instead of once <emphasis>per
          received <constant>EFSD_FILE_EXISTS</constant> event</emphasis>.
	</para>
	<para>
	  There are two conceivable situations when you encounter the need
	  for options:

	  <itemizedlist mark="opencircle">
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Static combinations of options, known at compile time.</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Dynamic combinations of options, unknown at compile time.</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>
	  
	  Consequently, &lefsd; provides two means for plugging options together. All
          options are constructed using the <function>efsd_op_XXX()</function> calls. For
	  the static case, there's the <link linkend="API-efsd-ops"><function>efsd_ops()
	  </function></link> function, which is variadic. You pass it the number of options
          you are using, and then call the needed option constructors. An example:

	  <programlisting>  
EfsdConnection *ec;
EfsdCmdId id;
EfsdOptions *ops;

/* Connection setup, etc. */

/* Assemble an EfsdOptions structure, containing 2 options:
 * one to list all files (as in ls -a), and one to request
 * alphabetical sorting of the listed files.
 */

ops = efsd_ops(2, efsd_op_list_all(), efsd_op_sort());

/* Now simply pass ops along with the command: */

if ( (id = efsd_listdir(ec, "foo/bar", ops)) < 0)
  {
     /* Could not send command. Continue accordingly. */
  }
	  </programlisting>

	  <caution>
	    <title>You do not need to <function>free()</function> the options.</title>
            <para>
              The <classname>EfsdOptions</classname> are already deallocated by the time
              the &efsd; command returns.
            </para>
	  </caution>

	  The other case is when you need to assemble options dynamically, at runtime
	  <footnote><para><link linkend="efsdshell">&efsdsh;</link> is an example of an application
          where this happens.</para></footnote>. Just create an <classname>EfsdOptions</classname>
          structure using <function>efsd_ops_create()</function>, and then add options created via
          <function>efsd_op_XXX()</function> using <function>efsd_ops_add()</function>.

	  <programlisting>  
EfsdConnection *ec;
EfsdCmdId id;
EfsdOptions *ops;
int show_all, get_stat, get_type, sort;

/* Connection setup, etc. */

/* Determine which options are needed (I assume here
 * that there's at least one), and set the corresponding
 * flags (show_all, get_stat etc).
*/

ops = efsd_ops_create();

if (show_all) efsd_ops_add(ops, efsd_op_list_all());
if (get_stat) efsd_ops_add(ops, efsd_op_get_stat());
if (get_type) efsd_ops_add(ops, efsd_op_get_filetype());
if (sort)     efsd_ops_add(ops, efsd_op_sort());

if ( (id = efsd_start_monitor_dir(ec, "/some/dir", ops)) < 0)
  {
     /* Could not send command. Continue accordingly. */
  }
	  </programlisting>
        <note>
	  <title>If you don't want to give any options, just pass NULL as <classname>EfsdOptions</classname>.</title>
	  <para></para>
	</note>
	
	</para>
	<para>
        When using options on a file/dir monitoring request (through <link linkend="API-efsd-start-monitor">
        <function>efsd_start_monitor()</function></link>), you are guaranteed to receive
        the <constant>EFSD_FILE_EXISTS</constant> events before any results of options applied
	to the files that are covered by the monitor. You can <emphasis>not</emphasis>, however,
        rely on receiving the <constant>EFSD_FILE_EXISTS</constant> events and all the results
	generated through the options before receiving the <constant>EFSD_FILE_EXISTS</constant>
        event for the next file, or on any sequence in which those results arrive. The reason
        is that the actions requested by the options take varying amounts of time and
        &efsd; processes those actions in parallel.

      <title>Tour of the Source Files</title>
      <para>
         The purpose of this section is to give a quick overview of what's contained
         in the source files (contained in the <function>/efsd</function> subdirectory).
         The following naming scheme is used throughout the code:

	<caution>
	  <title>When writing new functions, make sure to use the <function>D_ENTER</function>
	    and <function>D_RETURN</function> macros!</title>
	  <para>
	    Those macros make sure that the call tree is displayed correctly. Only in
	    case of really minor functions or heavily called nested ones should you consider
	    leaving those macros out. They greatly help in case of debugging when you need
	    to pinpoint where things are going wrong.
	  </para>
	</caution>

      </para>
      <para>
	Also, please stick to the following conventions when adding new code:

	<itemizedlist mark="opencircle">
	  <listitem>
	    <para>Every non-static function has the prefix <function>efsd_</function>.</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>All functions declared in the same header file have the same sub-prefix
	      (e.g., every function declared in <function>efsd_monitor.h</function> begins
	      with <function>efsd_monitor_</function>). This should make it easy enough
	      to quickly find things even on a first read.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>Static functions use the same sub-prefix, but don't have the
	      <function>efsd_</function> prefix.
	    </para>

  <chapter id="efsdshell">
    <title>&efsdsh; - An Interactive &efsd; Client</title>
    <para>    	     
      The &efsd; distribution comes with a useful tool for testing and playing with &efsd;
      -- that's &efsdsh;, the &efsd; shell <footnote><para>"Shell" is a bit of exaggeration, since &efsdsh;
      provides only a small subset of a real shell's functionality.</para></footnote>. It provides
      a simplified command line prompt, where you can send commands to &efsd; in the usual fashion, i.e.
      a directory copy command is <function>cp -r /some/dir /some/other/dir</function> etc.
      Enter <function>help</function> at the prompt to get an overview of the available commands and
      options.
    </para>
    <para>
      Besides being useful for testing &efsd; commands, &efsdsh; is also great for testing &efsd;'s
      behaviour when handling multiple clients - just launch a bunch of &efsdsh;s and watch how
      file monitoring requests are answered in a few of them etc.
    </para>
    <para>
      Notice that &efsd; must be running when starting &efsdsh;, it does not do that for you.
    </para>
  </chapter>

  <chapter id="filetypesdb">
    <title>&efsd;'s Filetype Database</title>
    <para>
      &efsd; uses a comprehensive set of file magic tests to determine a file's type. This set
      is stored in an XML file and loaded and interpreted when &efsd; starts. It therefore is not a
      database in the usual sense where access to a large file on disk is optimized.
    </para>
    <para>
      There's an HTML browser for the filetypes which can be used for looking up file magic
      values, offsets etc. If you're looking at an HTML version of the manual, you can go
      to the browser <ulink url="./filetypes/index.html">here</ulink>.
    </para>
  </chapter>	  

  <chapter id="summary">
    <title>Summary, TODO list</title>
    <para>
      Well, software is never finished, and this also applies to &efsd;. You can always look at the
      TODO file in CVS to see what's currently missing. Patches are appreciated, please send them
      to the author at <email>cK@whoop.org</email>. At the time of this writing, the following things
      are missing:
      
      <itemizedlist mark="opencircle">
	<listitem>
	  <para>A thorough testsuite, especially for the cache interaction and the
	    functions in <filename>efsd_fs.c</filename>, i.e. the file copy/move/remove
	    code. Ideally this would be an automated set of tests to check if changes
	    broke anything. Think XP.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    A great feature would be to not only get the filetypes in a MIME type-ish notation,
	    but also in fully human-readable form (sort of like the file(1) output). Ideally
	    this would include internationalization and localization support.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      
      At the time of this writing (September 2001), &efsd; should be mostly stable. Contributions
      and patches are welcome, please send them to me at <email>cK@whoop.org</email> directly.
      I hope you'll enjoy using and programming &efsd;.
