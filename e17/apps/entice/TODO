Still left TODO

* Image rotation - rotate image 90 degrees left/right, rotate image 180
		    degrees
* Save Routine - for modified images, shouldn't be an option unless image
		    has been modified(i.e. rotated)
		    Add an "EnticeImageModified" Signal

* Add an entice-ish display mode to the container object in
		    e17/proto/esmart

* Handle more than just keys in entice_keys.[ch] i.e. modifiers

* Edje Part to get previewed image name and attrs

* Find a way to represent, what's visible currently, to the
  EnticeScroller

* Hook in delete callbacks, should be pretty easy

* Slideshow options, perhaps best done as an application argument ?

* Trash Can ? Somehow i missed this functionality in the old version

* update debian/ directory so debs can be built

* update entice.spec so you can build rpms

* write more themes, and write a document walk through of how to theme it

* user configurable font directories
