Just the stuff I can think of...

* someway to attach .directory.eap files to directories
* directory renaming?
* need to handle directories that aren't in the .order file. They come at
  the end of the list
* need to handle eapps that aren't in the .order file too
* E17 will look for the .eap in the directory first before checking the all
  directory.
* need to add monitoring of the .order files and the top directories
  - if something changes need to popup a warning to the user and ask if
    they want to reload the .order file
