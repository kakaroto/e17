Just the stuff I can think of...

* someway to attach .directory.eapp files to directories
* directory renaming?
* if an eapp is under the arrows in the left menu it will be clicked when
  you click the arrow
* need to handle directories that aren't in the .order file. They come at
  the end of the list
