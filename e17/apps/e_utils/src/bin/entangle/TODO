Just the stuff I can think of...

* need to add a scrollbar for the menu
* need to fix the ui bugs...
* maybe add engage support?
* someway to attach .directory.eapp files to directories
* directory renaming?
* if an eapp is under the arrows in the left menu it will be clicked when
  you click the arrow
