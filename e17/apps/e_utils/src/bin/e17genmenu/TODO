Re arrange fdo_menu code to better match the order the specs says to do
things in, making use of the new Dumb_List insert code to insert
expanded xml.

A seperate "strip common appdirs and such" pass.  Keep a hash of indexes
to Dumb_List elements, if the current appdir is in the hash, null out
the element the one in the hash points to, and replace the index in the
hash with a pointer to the new appdir, otherwise add it to the hash. 
Careful not to move the already pointed to appdirs.

Maybe setup a hash of function pointers for xmlame to call for each
token it finds.  Otherwise split the big blob of code in fdo_menus into
bite size chunks.

Convert more of this to use ecore.
